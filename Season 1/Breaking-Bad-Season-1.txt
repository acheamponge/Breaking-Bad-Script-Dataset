00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
Oh, my God.
2
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,780
Christ!
3
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,827
Shit.
4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26, 336
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
5
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,339

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Think, think, think.

6
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,511
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,168
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

8
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,211
Come on.
9

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,218
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:20,891
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

11
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24, 936
To all law-enforcement entities,
this is not an admission of guilt.

12
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,065
I am speaking to my family now.

13
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,782
Skyler.

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,201
You are the love of my life.

5
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,370
I hope you know that.

6
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,790
Walter Jr.
7

00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,084
You're my big man.

 

8
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,047
There are--

There are going to be some things--—

19
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,883
Things that you'll
come to learn about me...

20
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,760
...in the next few days.

21
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:02, 432
I just want you to know

that no matter how it may look...

22
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,268
...-I only had you in my heart.

23
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,026
Goodbye.

24
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14, 856
--money before the panel
earlier this year.

25
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,525
Happy birthday.

26

00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,195
Look at that.

27
O0205321.,071, => 00205: 23,582
That is veggie bacon.

28
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,534

Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol...

29
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,286
...and you won't even
taste the difference.

30
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,914
What time do you think
you'll be home?

31
00705:31,081 --> 00:05:32,249
Same time.

32
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,543
I don't want him
dicking you around tonight.

33
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,588
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,591
Hey.

35
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,427
-Hey, happy birthday.
-Well, thank you.

36
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,471
You're late again.

37
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,266
There was no hot water again.

38
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,309

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I have an easy fix for that.

39
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,106
You wake up early, and then you get
to be the first person in the shower.

40
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,899
I have an idea.

41
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,321
How about
buy a new hot-water heater?

42
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,285
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

43
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,290
-Did you take your echinacea?
-Yeah.

44
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,417
I think it's getting better.

45
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,086
What the hell is this?

46
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,462
-Hey.

-It's veggie bacon.

 

47

00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,507
We're watching our cholesterol,
I guess.

 

48
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,428
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.

49
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,221
Too bad. Eat it.

00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,852
-This smells like Band-Aids.
-Eat it.

51
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,278
-So how does it feel to be old?
-How does it feel to be a smart-ass?

52
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,822
Good.

53
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,117
Eat your veggie bacon.

54
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,888
-You're all set?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,016
-All right, see you at home.
-Okay, see you.

56
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,396
Chemistry.

57
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,316
It is the study of what?

58
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,194
Anyone?

59
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,905
Ben.

60
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29, 866
-Chemicals.
-Chemicals.

61
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,410
No.

62
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,038
Chemistry is....

63
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:40,418
Well, technically,
chemistry is the study of matter.

64
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,713
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,549
Now, just-- Just think about this.

66
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,259
Electrons.

67
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,011
They’. .«

68
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
...change their energy levels.

69
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,224
Molecules.

70
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,227
Molecules change their bonds.

71
00207: 57,811 <-> 00:08:02,524
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

72
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,402
Well, that's-- That's all of life, right?

73
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,196
I mean, it's just--
It's the constant, it's the cycle.

74
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:13,243
It's solution, dissolution,
just over and over and over.

75
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,415
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

76
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,421
It is fascinating, really.

77
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,386
Chad.

78
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,973
Is there something wrong
with your table?

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,729
Okay, ionic bonds.

80
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51, 614
Are you done?

81
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,454
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.

82
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,468
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

83
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,635
There's your receipt.

84
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,180
Just hand this disc
to your car-wash professional.

85
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,640
Thank you. Come again.

86
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,155
He's not coming. He says he quits.

87
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,324
I'm gonna run the register.

88
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,327
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

89
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,954
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

90
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,542
Walter?

91
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,962
What am I to do?

92
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,360
Hey, Mr. White.

93
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,031
-Make those tires shine, huh?
-Oh, my God.

94
O0#10215,198 => 00s102 17,742
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

 

 

95
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,828
Mr. White.
96

00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,204
From chemistry.

97
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,101
Surprise!

98
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,103
Happy birthday, Dad.

-Happy birthday.

01
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,532
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.

I mean, you're flat as a washboard.

02
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,409
You look awesome.

 

03
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,413
-She's not showing at all, is she?
-She's showing a little.

104
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,208
Carmen, this is my sister, Marie.

105
OO: 207,375 --> 00: 209,544
-Nice to meet you.

-Hi.

Glock 22,
that's my daily carry, okay?

what, Plus P Plus loads...

Shit, I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

-Yeah. Dad, come check this out.
-Yeah, I see it.

115

-Come on, take it.
-Yeah. Check it out, Walt.

116

-No, no, it's just heavy.
-That's why they hire men.

117

Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up,

I'm gonna give a toast, a little toast
to my brother-in-law. Come here.

1241;
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,306
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin...

...-but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

But your heart's in the right place.

Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

127
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,871
At which point we apprehended three
individuals and placed them in custody.

128
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29, 666
I'm proud to say
the outstanding professionalism...

129
00212 $29,832 == 008125 33,127
...of my fellow agents
at the Albuquerque District Office...

130
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,005
-resulted in a substantial amount
of methamphetamine...

131
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,674
...being taken off the streets.

132
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,676
-Were any shots fired?
-No, ma'am.

133
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,886

by surprise.

Sorry. You didn't see that.

-Hank, how much money is that?
-It's about 700 grand.

141
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,992
It was a pretty good haul.

142
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,036
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque...

143
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,039
.-when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

 

 

144
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,334
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?
That kind of cash?

145

The visitor center has an exhibit on

You're not gonna paint?
-No, I'll paint.

164
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,963
It's just that this--

You know, this exhibition
on the Mars-rover photographs are....

166
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,139
I mean, the detail
really is just supposed to be amazing.

 

 

167
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,975
It's just that I really need you to paint
at some point.

Can't we just dump them here?

5

What, and somebody finds them?

..we will go our separate ways.

34
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,879
Our paths will never cross.

35
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16, 339

Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

52
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,918
We had a faculty meeting
last Thursday...

53
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,755
...and the topic was
senior-class photos...

54
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,550
...and how we had instituted
a new rule last year...

55
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,678
...that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken...

56
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,055
..-by a photographer of their choice.

57
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,683
You know, not necessarily
the photographer...

58
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,561
...that the school hires, right? So--

59
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,398
So anyway,
some of the senior girls...

60
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:44,696
..were going to that Glamour Shots
place to have their photos taken.

And now they're bringing us
all these photos...

62
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,409
...and Joan Everman--
You know Joan.

63
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,704
--suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

64
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,583
...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

65
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,547
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

66
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,716
Yeah. I'm good.

67
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,051
Okay.

68
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,597
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

69
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:16,937
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

70
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,772
The Wonderbra.

 

71
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,067
It's the Wonderbra.

 

72
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah?

73

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,613
Okay.

74
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,495
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

75
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:37,082
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

76
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,627
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&amp;T calling.

77
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,922
Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?

78
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,175
Because if you're not,

I would definitely really, really love...

79
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,594
»..to talk to you
as soon as possible about--

80
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51, 638
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

81
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,848
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

82
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,684
You said he would die any minute.

83
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,145
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now...

84
00#072:59,381L2 => 00:08: 02,273
...and I really don't appreciate

these sales calls.

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,859
Well, too bad, man,
because guess what.

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,277
He's still not dead.

87
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,154
I went and put my ear to the RV.

88
002083 08,321 =—> 00:08: 11,366
I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?

89
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,828
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

90
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,163
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out here.

91
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,125
-Calm down, damn it.
-You gonna help me clean this up?

92
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,378
-We got loose ends here.
-Calm down.

93
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,171
I will be there after school.

94
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,465
After school. Are you shitting me?

95
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29, 634
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

96
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,470

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Listen, that is just
not gonna work for me.

97
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,305
I'm not interested in that at all.

98
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,809
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

99:
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,521
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,154
-You have a good day, sweetie.
-Okay, Mom. You too.

101
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,031
Bye, honey.

102
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,996
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

103
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:15,180
Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.

104
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,017
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

105
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,869
So the term "chiral"...

106
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,372
...derives from the
Greek word "hand."

107
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:47,545
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:52,217
...are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite...

109
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,261
...well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist...

110
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,224
...asS mirror-image forms
of one another...

111
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,392
...all the way down
at the molecular level.

12
00210:01,559 =-> 00:10:05,230
But although they may
look the same...

3
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,733
...they don't always behave the same.

4
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,069
For instance....

5
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,490
For instance.

6
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19, 828
I'm sorry. For instance....

 

 

 

7
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
Thalidomide.

O0210¢21,746 ==—> 00°10226,501
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

119
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28, 628
...is a perfectly fine, good medicine...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
120
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,756
...to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

121
00310:31,923 =-> 00:10:35, 635
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman...

122
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:40,181
...the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

123
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:46,020
...and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

124
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,608
Which is precisely what happened

in the 1950s.

125
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:56,948
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?

 

126
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:01,661
Active, inactive, good, bad.

127
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,374
so.

128
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,377
-Yes, Ben.
-Is this gonna be on the murder?

129,
00211:12,297 --> 00:11:13,381
What?

130
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,009
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

Chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

Now what?

46
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,342
Lock the other one out in the RV.

47

-You know what?

-Feel free to go check.
-Good idea. Maybe I should...

151
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,561
...before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

 

52
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,188
-Okay, you know what? am sick--
-All right.
53
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,731
Just-—
54
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,734

 

The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

155
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,405
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

156

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,906
Krazy-8.

157
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,701
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

158
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,539
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

159
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,625
So you work with him regularly.

160
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,794
No, not him so much.

161

00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,714

-His cousin, mainly.
-Who's his cousin?

162
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,717
-The guy out in the RV.

-All right, all right, all right.

 

 

163
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,428
Krazy-8's one level higher.

164
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,096
One level higher.

165
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,933
Yeah, you know.

Not, like, street level. Higher.

 

166
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,978
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

167
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,815
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

168
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,609
Okay, so he's a distributor.

169
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, so is he...? I mean, is...?

170
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,994
In other words,
what is his reputation for violence?

a Gal,
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,416
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

172
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,920
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

173
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,590
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

174
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,967
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is...

175
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,930
...capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

176
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55, 640
What?

177
00:16:55,806 --> 00:17:00,520
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

 

 

178
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,440
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen...

1719
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,319

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

..if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

180
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,863
No Colombian neckties?"
That kind of reason?

181
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,825
No, man, I can't say as I have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

82
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,833
What was that?

83
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,002
What was what?

84
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,011
We didn't tie him up.

85
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,973
-Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
-Oh, God.

 

 

 

86
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,810
-Because he was out cold.
-Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

187
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:45,314
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

188
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,986
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

189
00%17750,152 s=> 003173 52,321
Ready to pounce.

190
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,680
No, see. Now, if it was me...

191.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,391
...and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon...

192
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,228
would just lie back down
and bide my time.

193
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,409
So now what do we do?

194
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:30,920
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

 

195
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,964
-Well, you gotta do something.
-We.

196
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,426
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

97
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,096
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

98
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,098
Don't you dare put that on me.

 

99
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,601
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

200
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,104
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

201

I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny...

203
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,571
-but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
in the RV.

204
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,789
What about the phosphate gas?

205
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,458
Phosphine gas. What about it?

206
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,294
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

207
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,005
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

208
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,801
I don't know.

209
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,470
-You're supposed to be a scientist.
-Look.

210
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,975
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

214
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,562
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

212
00220:29,729 =-> 00:20:31,021
Understand?

213
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,483
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

214

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,902
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

215
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:41,907
Now, that last part
is very, very important.

216
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:47,037
Therefore, it seems to me...

217
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:52,835
...that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

218
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,133
Dissolving in strong acid.

219
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,684
Oh, man, that's messed up.

220
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,855
I mean, you're not serious.

22.1.
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,776

the body situation...

the Krazy-8 situation.

Polyethylene.

.to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

383
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,891
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

384
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,393
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement...

385
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45, 688
...the one who's completely
my responsibility...

386
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,150
..-hell, let's just
let him live down there.

387
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:54,864
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

388
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:01,162
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

389
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:06,000
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

390
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,692
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

391
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,198
-What?
-You said you were...

392
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:42,036

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

..-just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

393
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,874
-He's a brother-in-law.
-Well, there's a load off my mind.

394
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,251
Where did you hear that?

395
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,380
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

396
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,425
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

397
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,720
Good job on
wearing the pants in the family.

398
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,974
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

399
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,978
Because somehow
it seemed preferable...

400
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,607
...to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

401
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,659
Is that what I think it is?

402
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,580
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

403
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,082
Hey, no, no.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Don't give me that, okay?

404
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:32,753
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around...

405
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,423
-...trying to get your nut up.
-Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

406
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,592
I have the truly awful job here.

407
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,802
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

408
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:44,140
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

409
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,601
I barely got him in the bathtub.

410
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,188
Bathtub, what...?
What do you mean, bathtub?

411
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52, 982
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town...

412
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,484
..-trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic...

413
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,945
..when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

414
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,118
Oh, God.

00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,787
Hey. Hey.

416
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,054
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.

417
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,517
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

418
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:13,271
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

419
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:20,027
It will, however, dissolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramic.

420
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,363
So there's that.

421
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,299
Okay, here we go.

422
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,057
Okay.

423
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57, 398
Here I go.

00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,255
Let's break it down.

2
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,717
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,720
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,014
Sixty-three?

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57, 641
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,978
-My next step's gotta be oxygen.
-Oxygen, 26 percent.

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,355
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

8
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06, 942
-Carbon, 9 percent.
-Carbon, 9.

9
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,070
-For a total of 98 percent.

-Right.
0
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,533
-Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.

-One-point-two-five.

1
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,035
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

 

2
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,205
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
13
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,958
...down where the magic happens.

14
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,920
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

15
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,922
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

16
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,799
-You would think, right?
-Right.

17
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,553
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

18
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:39,474
What? That low? Seriously?

19
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,393
Damn, I never would've thought that.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46, 398
-Okay, so where does iron fit in?

-Iroen,

 

 

21
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:53, 447
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,534
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,579
-Apparently, it don't take much.
-No doubt. Go figure.

24
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04, 625
-Sodium.
-Sodium, 0.04.

25
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:11,548
-Phosphorus, 0.19.
-Point-one-nine.

26
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,675
There we go.

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,679
So the whole thing...

28
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:24,353
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,361
We are 0.111958 percent...

30
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34, 696
2 SAY.

31
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,533
-Supposedly, that's everything.
-Yeah?

32
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,703
I don't know, it just....

33
00:02:41,870 =-> 00:02:43,121
Tt: JUS. wos
34

00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,457
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

35
008022 47,959 => 00:02: 51,713
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

36
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,079
I hate these shoes.

37
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,998
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

38
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,084

...like I should be squeaking around...

39
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,837
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

40
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,005
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

41
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,425
Then why are you wearing them?

42
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,929
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

43
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,771
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

44
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,817
I gotta go take this.

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,528
Female?

46
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,781
Louis.

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,452
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

48
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05, 620
-Just be quick about it.
-No.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
49
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:10,208
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,170
You can't know how much I hate that.

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,970
You missed a spot, right there.

52
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,847
Should you be on that ladder?

53
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,516
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

54
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,977
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,355
Yeah, there's an idea.

56
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,360
So I'm working on
this new short story...

57
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,157
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to....

58
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,577
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

59
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:51,333
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

60
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,087
I mean, you at least tried it.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
61
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,008
Come on.

62
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:06,014
I perhaps tried it. Why?

63
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,517
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

64
00205:08,683 =—> 00:05: 10,'852
Like, changing it in any major way?

65
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13, 688
It made me more serious.

66
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,524
Really?

67

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,029
Because I mostly remember it made me

light-headed, that's about it.

68

00805321,822 ==> 00:05:26,034
I was just wondering
if it maybe could....

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,375

You know, it's just a character thing

I'm stuck on. Never mind.

70
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36, 628
-Walter Jr.'s on pot?
-What? No.

71
00205:36,837 ==> 00:05:38,547
No. No.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,258
-What would make you even--?

-Where's he getting it?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
73
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,928
-Marie.
-Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

74
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,474
-What are you gonna do about this?
-Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

15
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,562
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

76
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,316
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot...

77
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,403
-certainly not as far as I know.

78
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,072
Not as far as you know?

79
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,116
Marie.

80
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,183
Hey, look at me.

81
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,979
Hey, turn around and look at me.

82
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,362
This.... This here.

83
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,532
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

84
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,536
This is degrading.

85

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,917
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,005
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

87
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,258
But I won't.

88
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,885
So either kill me, or let me go.

89
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,723
You don't have it in you, Walter.

90
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,520
How do you know my name?

91
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:46,067
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

92
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,404
I came by to sell you meth.

93
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,075
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

94
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,244
Not even close.

95
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,042
What else did he tell you?

96
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,129
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

97
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,590
You were his high school teacher.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,800
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

a9
00209: 10,967 => 00:09: 13,595
...by making grape soda in class.

100
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,058
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

101
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,480
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

02
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,857
That partner of yours...

03
00:09%26,066 --> 00:09:27,192
..-he's got a big mouth.

04
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,779
Walters oo.
05

00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33, 448
..-I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

06
00:09:33,615 --—> 00:09:35,283
2».but trust me...

07
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38, 620
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

08
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43, 958
So I should just let you go, then.

09
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,671
Just unlock you and...adios, huh?

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

I don't see
what real choice you have.

111
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,677
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

112
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,971
Besides. «.

113
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,141
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

114
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,162
Occupied.

115
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,374

yo, I'm trying to pinch one

What are you doing, man?

00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,887
-You asshole. What--?
-You told him my name.

 

120

-Says who, him?
-My name, where I work.

121
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,767
-You told him about my son.
-Hey, don't touch me.

122
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,562
-You damn junkie.
-No, give me that. That's mine.

123
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,897
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

124
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,607
No, that's worth 40 grand, you--

125
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,527
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

126
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54, 696
Get off the toilet.

127
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56, 698
-Get off the toilet!

-No.

28
00:10:58,741 --> 00: 0:L,:87 0
Get off the toilet.

Stop it.

No. No way.

-Kiss my pink ass, man.

I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

141

44

Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

161
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:35,481
-So I need you to focus, and--
-Hey, sit down! Sit down!

-Skyler told you that?
-She inferred it.

72

She inferred it, huh?

73
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,516
She strongly inferred it.

74
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:16,272
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

 

75

-All right.

215

Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

248

-What are you, like, handicapped?

261

No, I think they just wanted pot.

Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

280

-I don't think so, Walt.
-Honey....

281
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,828
Wherever you are...

282
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,914
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

Skyler?

285
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22, 633
Walter?

286
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,426
Hello?

287
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,429
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.

288
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,445
Come on.
289
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,886
Damn.

290
00:24:31,345 <-> 00:24:33,722
I didn't think you were coming back.

291
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,655
How long was I out?

292
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,574
Ten, 15 minutes?

293
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,247
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

294
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,457
You breathe in the same shit
you used on me?

295
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,884
I've got lung cancer.

296
002254 35,617 == 002253 38,120
I'll make you another sandwich.

297
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,825
Ti"s sate.

298
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,828
There's no poison.

299
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,167
Because that would be
the way to do it...

300
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,878
...-if you're gonna do it.

I suppose it would.

302
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,008
I mean...
303

00:26:33,175 =-> 00:26:35,761

...you being a chemist and all.

Do

304
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,865
So that name...

305
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,493
...Krazy-8.
306

00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,870
I really have to call you that?

307
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,706
I mean, no offense, but...

308
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,209

...don't you have a real name?

309
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,212
Domingo.

310
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,923
Domingo.

311
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,884
That's "Sunday," right?

312
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,224
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

313
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,726
Whatever.

314
00227:24,893 <-> 00:27:27,563
can't say I ever liked it much.
315
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,777
So, Domingo...

316
00227:33,944 => 00:27: 37,823
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

317
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,242
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

318
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,453
..is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

319
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,747
Not that I mind, you understand?

320
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,837
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

321
00#27:52,045 —<“> 00:27:53, 755
Well, maybe.

322
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,091
But maybe not.

323
00:27:59,261 ==> 00:28:01,972
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

324
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,601
I mean, any good reason at all.

325
002283115773 === 007285 13,859
Sell me.

326
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,111
Tell me what it is.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
327
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,159
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

328
00#282.22,326 —<—> 00:28:25,703
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

329
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,956
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

330
00228328,999 == 002285 30,292
..never happened.

331
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,129
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

332
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,508
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

333
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,136
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

334
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,804
You'll never know for sure.

335
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,977
So, what else can I tell you?

336
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,735
I don't know.

337
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,656
But you've gotta convince me.

338
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,494
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,997
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

340
00229: 09,248 => 00:29:11,500
I'm from here in town, man.

341
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,836
ABQ, born and bred.

342
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,922
Never left.

343
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,842
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

344

...got my degree.

345
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,180
Really?

346
00229527, 724 == 0022 95 31,353
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

347
002293 31,520 ==> 00329: 33,355
Doesn't hurt.

348
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,900
I was gonna study music originally.

349
002293 3.7,.359 => 00:29: 40,112
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

350
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,573
My pops talked me out of it.

Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

352
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,872
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

353
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,042
What does your dad do?

354
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58, 380
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

355
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,050
Wait a minute, I know that place.

356

Wait a minute. That's....

357

That's that....

358
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11, 643
They used to have those late-night--

359
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,104
-The stupid commercials.

-That they had, yeah.

360
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,441
Yeah, that's him.

Been doing them for over 30 years.

Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was....

Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

368
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,774
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

369
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02, 694
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

370

Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

371

He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

372
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,873
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven.'"

373
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,128
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I....

374
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,467
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

376
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,305
We did use to sell cribs.

377
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,060
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

378
00831735,268 ==> 002315 87,396
Yeah. No, I remember that.

379
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:43,652
In fact, I remember recognizing
your dad from those commercials.

380
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,322
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

 

 

381
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,408
Yeah. No shit.

382
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,160
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

383
O0831452,577 => 001312 54,579
Yeah, he probably did.

384
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,165
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

385
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,334
Yeah, that was his big thing.

386
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,169
You ask him for a glass of water...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
387
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,339
..-he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

388
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,720
-Did you work there too?
-Only my whole life.

389
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,849
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

390
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19, 938
So...

391
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,526
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

392
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,864
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

393
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,074
Might have even helped ring you up.

394
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,036
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

395
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,714
Small world.

396
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,925
It is.

Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

That's why you're cooking meth?

00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,734
...a little under the weather
this morning.

449
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:54,906
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

450
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,368

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

451
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,039
.»..on carbon.

452
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,540
Very important stuff.

453
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,589
-So, what do you think?
-It's a cook site. Gotta be.

454
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,051
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

455
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,054
Fire there could have started
by accident.

456
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,723
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

457
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,769
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

458
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,231
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

459
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,484
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

460
002434 31,651, ==> 00343233,402
Yeah. Why not?

461
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36, 656
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

462
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:44,914
-Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
-It's a rich and vibrant culture.

463
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,416
It's a car that jumps up and down.

464
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,085
What the hell?

465
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,421
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

466
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56, 676
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

467
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58, 636
I already searched it.

468
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,972
Yeah.

469
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03, 933
You're wasting your time.

470
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,770
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

471
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10, 606
-...than your dumb white ass to find it.
-Oh, yeah?

472
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,777
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

473
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm Rain Man counting

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

his toothpicks.

474
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,408
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

475
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,458
Yeah, baby.

476
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,174
-Hello, zippy.
-Asshole.

4717
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,928
Sort of looks like meth,
but it's too damn white.

478
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,183
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

479
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,144
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

480
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,812
Hey, agents.

481
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,814
You got something?

482
002453.26,515 => 00:45:29,060
I don't know. It just....

483
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,854
It just.... Doesn't it seem like...
484

00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,690
...something's missing?

485
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,026
What about the soul?

486
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,915

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

The soul.

487
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,300
There's nothing but chemistry here.

488
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,284
Skyler?

489
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,671
There's something I have to tell you.

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11, 637
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,972
-Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
-What?

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,267
-Ice Breakers, right? Breath mint?
-Nobody's gonna think that.

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,437
Gonna be thinking about some ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,440
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,444
I think Operation Breath Mint every
time you and me are on a stakeout.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,239
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit wagon.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:34,826
All right, Operation TBD.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,161
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,707
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,465
I turned him out when he was street,
but this dude's like The Jeffersons...

14
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,093
-...moving on up.
-Every dealer he'd throw at us...

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,264
-...he'd end up snaking their customers.
-He's missing, presumed dead.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57, 683
Found his car out in the boonies.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,979
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin...

8
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,897
..-Emilio Koyama.

 

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,525
You thinking the cousin found out
and took revenge?

20
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09, 361
Could be, turns out he's missing too.

21
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,906
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favor.

22
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,994
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it...

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,204
...we take it to the lab,
they come back...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
24
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,165
...they tell us it is the purest
they've ever seen.

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,001
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

26
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,753
Our chemist is blown away.
Said he couldn't do better.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,965
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico...

28
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,302
...we're thinking this was cooked
here in the Land of Enchantment.

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,972
Car was abandoned
at what appears to be a cook site.

30
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,641
This is the only other thing
left behind.

31
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,312
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

32
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,525
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,153
So be on notice.

34
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,656
We got new players in town.

35

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,994
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from...

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,622
...but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

37
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,999
Me, personally...

38
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,420
...I'm thinking Albuquerque
just might have a new kingpin.

39
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,749
Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

40
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,834
Damn it.

41
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50, 462
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

42
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52, 631
Emeril here
is gonna need a fresh pack.

43
00#02:54,758 =<—> 00:02:56,093
All right, looking good.

44
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,970
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

45
00202:59,596 ==> 00:03:02,265
I don't know, it's store-bought.

46
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,268
Okay, Hank, you need another beer?

47

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,020
Does the pope shit in his hat?

48
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,941
Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it...

49
00203¢11,108 --> 00:03:12,526
-if you'd stop saying that.

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,945
-Marie, some more wine?
-I'm all right, thanks.

51
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16, 947
-All right.

-Hey, I want a beer.

52
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,199
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

53
00203220,367 --> 00:03222,285
Guess what. It ain't happening either.

54
00203422,452 ==-> 00203224, 621
-How about some more soda?
-Yeah, sure.

55
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,790
Honey, do you need anything?

56
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,627
-No, Walt, thank you.
-Okay. Be right back.

57
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52, 983
-No.
-What, are you kidding me?

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,402
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

60
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,158
-Tell him how good-looking he is.
-He's adorable.

61
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,161
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable,
he wants to be hot.

62
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,872
See what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,042
-She's supposed to say that.
-Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like...

64
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,421
...you know, Charlton Heston--
I'm talking Moses days.

65
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,216
--to get a girl, all right?
You just gotta have...

66
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,677
«. confidence.

67
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,513
Confidence and persistence.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25, 932
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

69
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,685
I chased your aunt Marie here
all over creation.

70
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,563

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,398
What, I asked you, like, 50 times?

72
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,444
Yeah, it was before they tightened
the stalking laws.

73
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:42,449
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

74
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:47,370
-Tell him how you met Skyler.
-Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos...

715
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,249
...and Dad said that thing to you.

76
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,586
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress...

77
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,965
..it was a summer job,
and she was the hostess...

78
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,760
...and she also worked
the cash register.

79
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,639
And I used to go in there a lot because
it was close enough to the lab...

80
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,683
...where I could ride my bicycle.

81
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,394
And once I noticed her...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
82
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,942
..-it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.

83
OOF 05% L7,108 <> 00:05: 20,237
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter...

84
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,908
...-doing her crossword puzzles,
but kind of hiding it...

85
00205:25,075 =--> 00:05:27,244
..-pretending that
she was still working...

86
00205:27,410 ==> 00:05:29,579
...and once I caught on to that...

87
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,667
...I would do crossword puzzles while
I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich.

88
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,586
It got so that every day at lunch...

89
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,006
...we would both be doing The New
York Times crossword puzzle...

90
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,801
...10 feet from each other.

91
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,264
And eventually...

92
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,600
...-I caught her looking over at me...

93
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,687
...SO I began saying:

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
94
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:59,776
"Excuse me, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit...

95)
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,446
..-may I ask what you wrote down?"

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,784
And, well, that got us talking...

97
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,330
...and, boy, I tell you,
I was terrible at those puzzles.

98
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,293
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

99
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,629
But your mother
would do them in ink.

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,964
Very smooth.

101
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,885
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

102
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,221
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?

103
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,473
Once you set your cap
for something...

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,185
...0or somebody,
you gotta just, you know....

-Skyler.
-Mom, are you all right?

06
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42, 652
Hey, hey.
07

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,654
Honey, it's okay.

08
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,865
What's the matter?

09
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,828
What is it?

0
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,915
Ask him.
1

00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,425
What's she talking about?

2
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,557
Walt?

3
00207 £20,023 ==> 00207: 22,359
I have cancer.

Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.

We get through these things together.

And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen?

-You don't even smoke.
-You know, I'm thinking...

127

maybe...

I'll go across town--

276
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,240
Hell, I could go anywhere.

277
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,408
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.

278
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,496
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me
a partner for walking in the door...

279
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,041
-...that's how ecstatic they'd be.
-Next customer.

280
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,417
Hells, yes, brother man.

281
00#23:40,586 <-> 00:23:42,755
Dude, you should check this chick out.

282
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,591
Who? No.

283
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,760
Buddy, she's a cow.

284
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,762
Stacey's a cow.

285
00223250,262 +=> 002238752, 932
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

286
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,269
Roll her in flour and look for
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

287
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,230
That kind of stink does not wash off.

288
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,775
=Sir?
-Right.

289
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,693
Sas,

290
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,695
Oh, yeah?

291
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,948
-Sorry. Hi.
-Oh, totally.

292
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,283
-Hi. What can I do for you today?
-Which dude?

293
00#24:11,492 => 00224213, 953
-That dude that looks like a lizard?
-Next in line.

294
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,706
-And he limps like some leper.
-I'm sorry, I would like...

295
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,875
-...a cashier's check...
-Grosses me out.

296
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,293
...in the full amount...

297
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:26,298
...made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

298
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,387

Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

299
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,471
Yeah, you got it.

300
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37, 643
I don't understand
why they're forcing you...

301
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,603
...to choose between
piccolo and oboe.

302
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,605
You show so much promise
with both.

303
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,149
They can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

304
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,152
No matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

305
00224: 47,319 ==> 00°24250,572
-Rules are rules, I guess.
-Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for

306
00224: 50,739 => 00224753, 951
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

307
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,578
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

308
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
Thanks.

309
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,165
What about Mr. Pemberton?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

that.
310
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,626
Is he giving you enough
individual attention?

311
008252 02,793 => 00:25: 05,129
I'd say so.
He tries to talk to each one of us...

312
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,423
...at least once during every practice.

313
00225707,589 ==> 00:25:11,468
-That's good. Feedback's important.
-It's key, I think.

314
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,972
Hey, so how was soccer practice?

315
00225318,516 ==> 0025: 20,185
I think that was in our backyard.

6
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,446
Who's there?

317
002253 37,119 ==> 00225739,.537
What the hell are you doing out here?

 

318
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,876
Hey, Dad.

 

319
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,795
Hey, Mom.

320
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,839
Jake.

321.
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,717
Got new patio furniture.

322
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,511
Right on.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

323
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,224
My leg.

324
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,622
What do you think it could be?

325
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,377
God knows I'm no expert.

326
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,214
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

327
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,009
I think we should check his arms
for needle marks.

328
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,556
Do we let him stay?

329
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,893
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

330
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,730
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

33:1
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32, 693
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

332
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,745
-Hey.
-Hey. Good evening.

333
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46, 664
Well? Sleep well?

334
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,252
What time's--? What time is dinner?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

335
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,881
In about an hour.

336
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
You know,

I could wash those clothes if you like.

337
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,972
They look a little lived in.

338
00#28203,223 => 00:28: 06, 727
No, that's cool. Maybe later.

339
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,941
We are not doing this again.

340
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,943
No.

341

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,280

We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

342

00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,408
We just have to be
consistent about it.

 

343
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,789
Hey.

344
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,543
You're not taking the bus?

345
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,174
All right. Well, listen.

346
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,844
Give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.

347

-All right.
-All right.

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,892
Yeah, good.

349
00229359,589 ==> 00730: 03,218
You know, I just think that...

350
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,850
...things have a way
of working themselves out.

351
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,793
When did you get this?

35.2
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,171
Last May at the year-end assembly.

353
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,341
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

354
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,220
Environmental Consciousness
Award.

355
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,224
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

356
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,226
I contacted
The Albuquerque Journal...

357
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,229
...and asked what chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

358
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,524
-Wound up writing an article about it.
-Right on, little bro.

361
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,323
Now, hey, remember...

362
00#31:06,490 => 00:.312 10,327
.-not all learning
comes out of books.

363
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,749
Look at you.

364
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,919
You know, we should--
We should hang out more often.

365)
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:23,340
You know, just kick back and chill.

366

00231'23,548 ==> 00961228,595
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

367
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,724
Because, you know, I've been--
I've been through it all. For real.

368
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39, 606
Yeah, man, you-- You play the flute?

369
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44, 361
-It's a piccolo, actually.
-Dude, play some Jethro Tull.

 

 

370
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,117

-Jake?
-Yeah. Fine, Mom.

00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:02,254
Well, that's good. That's great.

374

You know, what the hell?
You see this?

375
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,059
What am I,
some criminal or something?

376
00232 417,060 == 00232: 19, 771
-Whatever.
-Whatever?

377

What, you think that's okay?

378

Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favorite son."

379
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,573
I'm the favorite?

380
00232:30;782 <--> 00:32:32,576
Yeah, right.

381
00232:32,742 #-> 00:32:34,953.

all they ever talk about.

-Yeah?
-Yo, man, it's me.

385

Hey, listen. You know that product?

386
00234 257,929 => 00:34:59, 639
You got any more of that?

387
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01, 933
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

388
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04, 436
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

389

No, no charity. No.

390
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,940
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

39.1,
008353 09,107 => 00:35: 11, 943
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offense.

I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

405
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,997
What the hell's wrong with you?

406
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,999

-Nobody. What, are you nuts?

409
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,758
Then why are you here?

410
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,387
I don't know.

 

411
00236:20,553 ==> 00736: 23,848
To, like, touch base.

412
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25, 642
Touch base?

413
00236526,810 ==> 0073.6: 28,853
Yeah, you know.

414
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,691
What they call a debrief.

415
002363 32,857 ==> 00736: 34,567
Maybe we could, like--

416
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,528
Thought we could debrief.

417
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,571
Debrief?

418
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,573
Wow, that's--

 

419
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,993
That's what you think we need,
debrief?

Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

421
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,377
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

422
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,422
I mean, we can't talk to anybody else.

423
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,718
Anyway, that and I wanted to--

424
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,052
Wanted to, you know...

425
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,181
...tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

426
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:09,394
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.

427
00237:10,395 --> 00:37:16,526
Seriously. I got dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

428
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,904
-Great.
-I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever...

429
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,782

433
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,763
Now.

434
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,224
All right.

435
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,477
All right, you know what?

436
00237:50,643 ==> 00337:52,729.
Four grand.

437

Your share from selling that batch.

00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:36,105
Stage 3A, which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

442
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,775
There's no denying it's very serious.

443
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,611
But at-= Is iteH?

444
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,988
It is...

445
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,157

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...curable?

446
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,244
I prefer the word "treatable."

447
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,789
But the treatments we have
at our disposal can be very effective.

448
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,334
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course...

449
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,588
...of radiation and chemotherapy I'm
going to suggest has been successful.

450
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,134
In certain cases, it's prolonged a
patient's life and resulted in remission.

451
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,514
What about the side effects?

452
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,184
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

453
00:39:13,393 =-> 00:39:15,311
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

454
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,148
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss...

 

455

00239:19,315 =-> 00:39:23,152
..-which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

 

456
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,656
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
457
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,658
You won't want to get out of bed.

458
00239:3.28,825 => 00:39:32,871
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

459
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39: 36,291
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

460
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,336
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea...

461
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,173
...although we'll prescribe an
antiemetic and try to counteract that.

462
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,175
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

463
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,845
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

464
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:55,'059
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry....

465
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,256
Got anything to say?

466
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,389
What do you know about that?

467
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37, 685
-Nothing.
-Well, that's not gonna fly this time.

468
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,605
How many chances

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
have we given you?

469
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,690
How many times have we
sat right here...

470
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,360
...and had the same conversation
over and over again?

471
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,029
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

472
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,781
And you play on our emotions...

473
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,201
..-and tell us anything and everything
you think we want to hear...

474
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,954
...just so we'll give you
another chance.

475
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,500
And it makes us feel like fools.
Every time.

476
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,798
Enough, Jesse.

477
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,299
Enough.

478
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,428
We are not going to have this
in our house.

479
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,391
We need you to leave.

480

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,016
Thanks for not telling on me.

481
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,189
You think I could have it back?

482
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,123
It's skunk-weed anyway.

483
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,144
The Air Force is aware
of the widely held belief...

484
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,813
...that some of these
could be flying saucers from--

485
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,232
You know,

this is actually very hopeful.

486
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,193
Nothing conclusive
in the evidence...

487
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,071
..-but probing and digesting
of information about UFOs...

488
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,739
...continues unceasingly.

489
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,741
Did you hear me?

490
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,411
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

491
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,415
Defense Command in
Colorado Springs issued an order--

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
492
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,128
So can I call them
and tell them you'll start next week?

493
00243:11,339 =-> 00:43:13,841
Even as they did so,
the military wondered whether...

494
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,594
...their scientific know-how
and their best weapons...

495
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:23,601
..would be effective in any battle
of the Earth versus the flying saucers.

496
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:29,107
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.

497
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,734
What is there to discuss?

498
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,404
You're gonna get the best treatment,
and he's the best.

499
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:41,202
Well, there's the money discussion.
I think-- No, $90,000 out of pocket.

500
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,246
-Maybe more.
-There's a way, Walt.

501
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,747
There's financing...

502
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:49,210
...there's installment plans.

I could always go back to work.

503

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,880
-Walt, there's always a way.
-All right.

504
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,050
Skyler, say that there is a way.

505
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,303
And we spend all that money, and....

506
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,403
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

507
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,322
No. Honey.

508
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,118
I just don't want emotions ruling us.

509
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,746
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

510
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,334
Then why don't you just fucking die,
already?

511
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35, 965
Just give up and die.

512
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,892
Come on, move your ass.

513
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,312
Name of the guy? You'll like him.

 

514
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,567
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.

515
002453 36,733 =-> 00:45:39,237
I would not want to be

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

on the other side of this one.

516
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,574
He's got this little team of ninjas too
that go out and do covert operations--

517
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,910
He's got crap on people.

518
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,067
What the hell?

519
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,449
-What?
-Don't go near it, buddy.

520
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,077
What--? What are you doing?
Call somebody. Call the fire people.

521
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,996
Yeah. I have a fire....

522
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,999
I don't believe this.
Do you know how much I paid for that?

523
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,256
Why is it doing this?

00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,299
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,802
I mean, technically it says
"curriculum vitae"...

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,973
..which I think is more professional,
but, you know...

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16, 683
...Same thing, pretty much.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18, 685
That's-- Wow, great.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,855
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:25,275
And it doesn't really say it here...

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:29,363
..-but I have a solid background
in sales.

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,490
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so0....

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,867
-That's excellent, but--
-Excellent.

At
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,202
I just...

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,163
..-I really feel I could be a major...

13

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,500
..major asset to your sales force.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,257
This isn't actually a sales job.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:52,177
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you
for a sales position...

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,429
..-but all our agents
need to be licensed...

18
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,099
..-have at least two years
on-the-job experience...

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,850
-and usually a college degree.

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05, 649
What you'll be doing is more like...

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,734
..-advertising.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,207
Hey, Jesse.

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,543
Hey, man.

24
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,877
Yo, man.

25
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27, 963
-What up?

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Badger?

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,674
Where you been keeping yourself?

27
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,302
Nice duds.

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,220
Yeah, you too.

29
0001235,429 ==> 003013 37,139.
Thanks.

30
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,142
Yo, why would you wanna d
this lame-ass job, anyway?

ie)

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,144
I mean, no offense.

 

32
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,812
Because I'm on probation, yo.

33
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,357
I gotta prove to the man

I'm rehabilitated.

 

 

34
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,652
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.

35
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,572
It's really good exercise too.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,408
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

37
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,911
There's all these moves
you have to learn, like "the helicopter."

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
38
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,293
Yeah. See, yeah?

39
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,836
That one's a bitch.

40
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,671
I'm not very good at it yet.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,090
You really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

42
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,593
-Yeah.
-Hey, anyways...

43
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,971
-...thanks for the toke.
-Any time.

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,389
Speaking of which...

45
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,894
...you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

46
00#02:24,645 => 00:02:27,397
No, I've been out of the business
for a while.

47
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,858
Actually, now thinking about retiring.

48
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,069
-What? No.
-Yeah.

49
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,696
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

50
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,239
It was pretty awesome.

51
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,658
Retirement?

52
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,118
I can't be hearing this.

53
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,373
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, I was doing
most of the work...

55
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,213
...-but he was an asshole, so....

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,716
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and--

57
00202 :54,925 ==> 00202: 57,594
Yo, I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

58
00702:57,803 --> 00:02:59,513
Major pseudo.

59
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,099
I got channels, bro.

60
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,767
We could partner up.

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,104
No pressure.

62
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,731
No pressure.
Just think about it, all right?

63
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,484
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

64
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,454
Yo, this way to savings.

65
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,790
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

66
002034 32,629 ==> 002033 35,132
Big savings
This way and save

67
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,595
Come on! Save some money.

68
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,247
It's a stupid gift.

69
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,957
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

70
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,876
I don't know what I was thinking.

71
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,962
Didn't the invitation

even say "no gifts"?

72
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,881
-Walt.

-What?

 

13.
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,716
We have to go.

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,801
I know, I'm not complaining.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,219
Yes, you are.

76
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,807
Look, we need this.

77
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,269
We've been through a lot
lately. Okay?

78
00704:31,396 =-> 00:04:35,567
Jesus, guess we didn't get
the "beige" memo.

79
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,819
We're okay.

80
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,323
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

81
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,158
Honey, you look fine.

82
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,787
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

83
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,750
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts."

84
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,294
So? Come on.

85
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,798
Sir, I'll take that for you.

86
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,219

You made it.

92

Happy birthday.

-Wouldn't miss it for the world.

-Skyler.

Hi. Oh, that's right.

 

95

Great to see you.
You look beautiful, as always.

96
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,745
Well, these days a little more big
than beautiful, but....

97
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,374
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

It's really nice to be here.

-In about 10 more weeks.

105

-Oh, that's so wonderful.
~Yeah.

107
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,072
Yeah, we've been thinking about it
for ourselves.

108
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,574
Yeah, thinking about it.

109
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10, 662
Oh, hey, by the way...

110
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,748

Elliott.

Excuse us, we gotta say hi.

Make yourselves at home,
we'll catch up.

117

Long time no see.

-This is Walter White.
-Hello.

128
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,069
Back at Caltech, he was--

129
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,905
You were just a master
of crystallography.

30

00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,201
I remember this one time we were
stuck on this protein problem...

31
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,120
...for weeks.

32
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,622
You just breezed right in...

33
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,582
...and you had one word for us....

 

 

34

Synchrotrons.

It was synchrotrons, yeah.

This is the White in Gray Matter.

-Tell them, Walt.
-Okay.

139
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,061
Well, back when Elliott and I
were in grad school...

40
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,813
...we came up with the name.

41
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,066
Schwartz, black. Walter White.

42
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,153
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

 

43
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,905
-Cute, huh?
-So you run the company with Elliott?

144
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,908
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

145
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,287
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

146
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59, 664
What university?

147
002092 02,125 =e 00209205, 920

Not just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.

149
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,968
No way.

150
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,598
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle
Eric Clapton."

51
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,601
Thank you. This is beautiful.

52
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,603
-Why is he doing this?
-Beautiful.

Yeah, 10 for a dollar ninety-nine.

To this day,

I am convinced these noodles...

69

...were responsible for our success.

70
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,376
This was our lifeblood.

He had that thing under his nose.

-What do you call that thing?
-That was Dobkins.

always smelled like chocolate milk.

-It was.
-No, no, no.

183

...onto the elbows
of his Members Only jacket...

186
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,044

look distinguished.

-No.

used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29, 606
es. All you had to do

was mention the Bunsen burner...

K

193

-and he was off on a rant.

194

"Oh, he didn't invent it."
Do you remember the waving?

Listen, we ought to get together
more often.

you and should work together again.

-Are you gonna teach high school?
-No, no, no, seriously.

207

I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard...

...and trying to get these kids to learn
the periodic table.

 

218

Look, I understand.

219

You know when you've
been trying to crack some problem...

we can't work out.

They were, like, wow.
They were just--

 

237
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,902
I must have had about 30
of those suckers.

238

Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

239

They had lobster tail,
they had crab legs, like, shrimp.

Okay,

244

believe it.

245

we were talking,

he asked how you were doing...

246
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,430
...and I am sorry, but don't have
the best poker face these days...

247
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,015
..where that's concerned.
248
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,894
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.
249
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56, 604

He pressed you? Come on.

250
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,440
Walt, when it came right down to it...

251
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01, 984
...I didn't know what to do
but tell him the truth.

 

 

252,
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05, 988
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

253
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,202
You could have said that. "He's fine."
It would have been done.

254
002153 11,411 ==> 00215213, 121
I don't like the way you're talking.

257
00%15<420,3878 ==> 0031.53 22,797
Well, what exactly did he say to you?

258
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,340
-He offered me a job.
-What?

259
00215324,549 ==> 00215: 28,052
Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf,
you know.

260
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,680
Some face-saving bullshit...

261
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,058
...that allowed me

to generously accept his charity.

262
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,727
And then when I turned that down,

he flat out...

 

 

263
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38, 980
...offered to pay for my treatment.

264
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,358
Which is exactly what
you expected him to do, didn't you?

265
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,818
-Walt.
-Didn't you?

266
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,780
-No. I did not put him up--
-Please. Come on. Come on.

00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,304
-Look, Skyler--
-Not yet, please. I--

411
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,431
I have the talking pillow.

412
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49, 645
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
remember?

413
00#28:459,853 => 00:28:52,522
And then you'll get your chance.

414
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,652
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,988
But now that Elliott is more than willing
to pitch in--

416
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,450
Walt, I know, I understand
that it's hard for you to accept help.

417
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,702
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

418
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,788
But, honey...

419
00229:07,;996 =--> 00329: 11,959
..it's okay to lean on people
now and again.

 

420
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,419
You need this treatment.

421
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,464
And nothing can stop you
from getting it...

422
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,383
«..except you.

423

-Am I allowed to respond?
-In a minute.

424
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,564
I think we need
to go around the circle first.

a25
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,694
Hank, would you like to start?

426
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,826
Yeah. Okay, well....

00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,370
-What I would say is--
-Take the talking pillow.

428
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,421
All right, look, buddy...

429
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:02,467
...-I know I don't get to
tell you this enough...

430
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,263
...-but I care about you.

431
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,057
A hell of a lot.

432
002302 09,725 <-> 00:30: 11,560
And this cancer thing....

433
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,189
Let's just-- Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

...sometimes your luck can change.

436

I mean--

437
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,532
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I was-- I started with a shit hand...

438
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:29,411
...and I ended up with a, you know,
a full house. Okay?

439
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,913

I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

440
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,251
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets.

441
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,421
Hank...

442
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,591
-...what the hell are you saying?
-Please, Marie, let him talk.

443
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,969
That's what we're here to do. Please.

444
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,764
Go on, Hank.

445
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,769
All right, look at it this way, okay?

446
002302 53,977 => 00:30: 56,938
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded...

447
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,774
...you're up.

448
002303 59,316 ==> 007313 01,610
But you got a bum arm, right?

449
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,072
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

450
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,909
So you can either let the pinch hitter
take the bat...

451
00231:309,117 =-> 00:31:13,121

-or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

452
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,457
You get what I'm saying?

453
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,543
No.

454
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,507
You got your pride, man.
I get it, okay? I get it.

455
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

456
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,889
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

457
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,269
Somebody wanna take this thing?
Here.

458

Yes, Walter--

459
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:43,777
Walter, Jr., I'm sure that you have
about a million things to say, probably.

460
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,488
And now is your chance.

461
00231:47,.322 =-> 00:31:50,992
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

462
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,621

Because you're being....

You're--

You're a pussy.

472

You're, like, ready to give up.

473
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,828
You're-- God.

474
00232:35,036 --> 00:32:37,539
What if you gave up on me, huh?

475
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,255

...all the stuff I've been through...

...and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

478
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,154
Me, personally...

479
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,742
...-I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

480
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,162
What?

481
00:33:17,954 =-> 00:33:20,373
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

482
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,709
Walt's the one with cancer,
it's his decision.

483
00233522,918 ==" 00733: 24,878
It's not up to any of us.

-Why in hell would you do this?
-Hey, hey.

485
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,886
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

486
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,097
After sitting and listening
to you all talk about his future...

487
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,726
-...like he has no say in it--
-He's not gonna have a future...

489

I am a medical professional.

490
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,902
I x-ray people in treatment
every day.

491
002332 49,110 “> 00:33: 51,i613
I see them every day.
And you know what?

492
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,575
Some of them
are absolutely miserable.

493
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,411
-Marie--
-I'm sorry, but it's true.

494
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,250
And some of them don't wanna spend
their last weeks or months...

495

496
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,588
But they got talked into it
by their families.

497
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,882
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie.

498
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,133
-Thank you.
-Hank--

499
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,469
What? Maybe Walt wants to die
like a man.

500
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,097
I don't want him to die at all.

501
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,642
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

502
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,853
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy...

503
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,314
-of giving you my honest opinion.

504
00234:26,523 =<—> 00:34: 30,151
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

505
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,740
-This is my husband's life--
-I made one simple observation--

506
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,452
-And it's like you-- How dare you--
-Okay, so we disagree--

507
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,705
Ladies! Marie!

508
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,459
This is so stupid.

509
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,008
All right,
I've got the talking pillow now.

510
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,677

...all I have left is
how I choose to approach this.

527
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,849
Then make the right choice, Walt.

528

You are not the only one it affects.

535
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,432

"All right" what?

I'll do the treatment.

It's gonna be okay.

...Said they usually bill
the insurance company directly.

But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

578
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,160
Hey, Gretchen, how are you?

579
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,205
You know, it was really great seeing
you two the other day, you know.

580
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,041
Wow, what a party.

581
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:33,337
Elliott told me about the cancer.

582
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,883
I'm so sorry.

583
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,802
Well, you know...

584
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,597
...it is what it is, I guess.

585
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,891
I don't know what to say.

586
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,186
Except, I'm always here for you.

587

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:52,231
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

588
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,194
Yeah, well, thank you.

589
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:02,491
Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered
to pay for the treatment.

590
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,743
You have to accept.

591
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,078
That money,
as far as we're both concerned...

592
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,539
...that belongs to you.

593
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:12,335
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

594
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,005
Walt?

595)
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,094
Is this about you and me?

596
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,609
Gretchen, I really appreciate
the offer.

57
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,363
I do. But we're fine.

598
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,951
As it turns out,
the insurance came through after all.

599

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,078
So...

600
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,747
...I am covered. And....

601
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,793
Well, and, anyway,
I really appreciate it, I really do.

602
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,795
Thank you.

603
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,173
Good. That's good news.

604
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03, 886
You know,

that really was a great party.

605
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:11, 602
-Keep in touch, okay?
-Sure. Sure, and...

606
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,063

1
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,844
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,598
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58, 642
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,645
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,026
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

6
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,487
I don't wanna see them,
I don't wanna hear them.

7
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,449
I want no interaction with them
whatsoever.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,248
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,917
You got any issues with that?

0
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,169
Whatever, man.

1
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,845
No matter what happens...

2
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,096
..no more bloodshed.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00201:38,307 ==> 00201: 39,683
No violence.

14
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,739
Walt?

15
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,325
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,285
Yeah, I'm okay.

17
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,040
You know, honey, you--
You really don't have to....

18
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,586
Look, I like being here with you.

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,047
Yeah.

20
008022 52,214 => 00:02255,.21.7
I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay...

21
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,886
...-that really, if you wanna go....

22
00202 259,262 ==> 00703203,475
You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better...

23
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,354
..-knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. gets home from school.

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,026
Okay.

25
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,114

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
All right.
So you'll call me when you're finished?

26
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,032
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,163
Oh, and have you been
in touch with Elliot?

28
00#032.25,330 => 00:03: 28,875
Because I haven't seen
a check from him.

29
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
Yes, I-- I got it.

30
00203231,169 ==> 00:03:34,339.
-Really?
-It came, yeah. And I--

31
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,174
Yeah, it did. It came last week...

32
002034 36,341 ==> 002033 39,511
..-and I put it right into
my credit union account.

33
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,764
So I'm taking care of it.

34
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,351
-Good.
-Yeah.

35
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,479
So we're good. We're good.

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:57,654
Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

37
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,616
Thank you.

38
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,162
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

39
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,956
Yeah.

40
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,856
Chemical reactions involve
change on two levels:

41
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,525
matter and energy.

42
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:41,782
When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

43
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,327
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

44
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:52,459
For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

45
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,509
But if a reaction happens quickly...

46
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,387
...otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way...

47
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:09,601
...that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

48
00#05213,021 -—> 00:05:19, 861
Who can give me an example

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
of rapid chemical reaction?

49
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,451
Hint, hint. Right here.

50
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,870
Like, an explosion?

51
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes, good. Explosions.

52
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,004
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions...

53
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,715
..-happening almost instantaneously.

54
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,469
And the faster reactants,
i.e. explosives--

55
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,347
And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

56
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,726
--the faster they undergo change...

57
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,896
.the more violent the explosion.

58
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,694
Explosions.

59
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,989
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own...

60
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,701
...from the top of chapter seven.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

61
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,800
You okay?

62
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,220
I got it, Mr. White.

63
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,055
Don't worry.

64
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,474
You got kids to teach.

65
00206251,912 --> 00706: 53,872
Thanks, Hugo.

66
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,385
He's starting to lose weight...

67
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07: 12,307
..which is tough, to see that.

68
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:18,563
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

69
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,406
-Can I talk to--?
-Of course.

70
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,951
Walt.

71
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,371
When you don't let me in...

72
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,040
...when you don't tell me
what's going on....

73
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,670
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

even want me around sometimes.

74
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,004
No.

75
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,008
And recently, these afternoons...

76
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49, 636
..-when you're coming home
so late. .«..

77
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:54,516
...and we're just left wondering
where you are.

78
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,893
Yeah, Dad.

79
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,397
What's up with that?

80
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:07,946
Walt, is there anything else

you're holding back from your family?

81
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,410
Now's the time to share.

82
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,417
Welly Ds weve

83
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:25,255

I like to be alone, I mean, at times.

84
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,675
And it's not about you, really.

85
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,804
It's just that sometimes
it feels better...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
86
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,726
».-not to talk at all...

87
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,687
..-about anything...

88
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,564
...tO anyone.

89
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,693
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

90
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,781
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone...

91
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,618

.-might make it easier for your family

to be more accepting...

92
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59, 622

.of whatever it is you do alone.

93
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,917
Well...

94
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,797
...I like to go on walks...

95
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,802
...a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

96
00#09212,969 => 00:09:18,975
And I really enjoy the nature.

97
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22, 312
You know, the cacti...

98
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,858

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-vegetation, that kind of thing.

99
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:33,281
It's really very therapeutic.

100

Yo, God, are you okay?

-Hey, you did that shit?
-I'm dizzy. No.

02
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,193
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

03

-God, I feel like I'm burning up.
-Sit down, sit down.

How did you know?

My aunt had one of those
dots on her...

This that one we found way out

-Yeah? What's it say?

-How much meth did you sell?
-Nearly an ounce.

00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,771
Last time I checked...

161
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,609
...there were 16 ounces to a pound.
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

162
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,944
Yo, I've been out all night
slinging crystal.

163
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,198
You think it's cake moving
a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

164
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,408
Why are you selling it
in small quantities?

165
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,203
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

166

To who?

What do I look like, Scarface?

67
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,918
This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

68
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,378
This return is too little for the risk.

 

69
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,589
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound.

Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

Oh, my....

Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just--

75
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,689
Just think outside the box here.

76
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,151

We have to move our product in bulk,

wholesale.

77

Now, how do we do that?

78

-What do you mean, to a distributor?
-Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

Badass, from what I hear.

184
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,485
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

185
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,613
Right. Like, "Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me...

186
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,075
..would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

187
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,245
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

188
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,414
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's OG.

189

-What-- What does that mean?
-Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

190

He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

the way it works.

...and start cutting deals.

194
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,807
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

195
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,934
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

196
00%18.:22,101, => 00:18:24,979
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from third grade.

197

-And we can't talk to Emilio, because--
-All right, all right, all right.

Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

you could help me with that.

No, no. No students have keys.

My question is...

248
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,328

know where you keep them?

-No.

-Glassware looking a little sparse.
-Is it?

256
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:20,357

00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,381
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

292
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,093
Break out the ice.

293
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,738
-Take a bump.
-No worries, man, I'm no cop.

294
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,741
I said, hit it.

295
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,329
All right.

296
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,889
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

297
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,893
-Where'd you get it?
-I cooked it.

No one, man. I mean, I have a partner
that I cook with, but that's it.

301
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,618
All right.

302
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,831
We got a deal.

303
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,916
See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

304
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,961
Cool. I haven't said how much.

305;
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,848
All right. How much?

306
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,850
Thirty-five large for the pound.

307
00228:09,855 => 00:28:12,816
Well, I mean, you're a little light, ese.

308
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,572
It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

309
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,698
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

310
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,702
-What about the money?
-You'll get it.

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,580
This is a consignment operation.

312
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,501
You want me to float thirty-five G's?

313
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,963
You don't trust me?

314
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,132
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.

 

35
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,469
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

316
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,347
Tough shit, the deal is done.

317
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,728
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

318
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,980
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.

319
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,193
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

320
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,282
Come on.

321
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,410
Oh, come on.

322
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:21,677
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal.

323

Up front.

325
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:26,616
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

326
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,887
Morning, Hugo.

327
00230:49,139 =--> 00:30:52,017
You don't mind if I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

328
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,398
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

329
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
Is that Uncle Hank?

330
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,780
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

331
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,617
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

332
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,245
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

333:
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,457
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

-Okay, I'll be right there.

You're looking good, Walt.
Your color's better.

Yeah? Thanks.

00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,997
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

344
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,876
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but--

345
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,671
Well, actually,
I just talked to Carmen this morning...

346

00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,882
...and they're getting a substitute

-Good.
-I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

348

-Sorry.
-Your bet, tough guy.

-That's 25 million, blue's 10.

 

353
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,025
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

354
00232: 24,526 =-> 00:32726,027
Hey, Uncle Hank...

355
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,198
...I heard you arrested
Mr. Archilleya the other day.

356
008322 30,365 ==>: 00232131,.533.
He's a pretty cool guy.

357
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,539
Well, turns out he has a record.
Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
358
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,251
We figured he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

35.9.
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,714
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

360
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:49,134
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

361
00232 $49,301, ==> 00732: 52,596
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

362
00%32:52,.762 => 00:32: 56,558
-It's to you, Walt.
-Yeah, I'll call.

363
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,894
You know,

I can't believe the school system...

364
00232 459,060 ==> 00733: 00,937
...didn't know
about this guy's record.

365
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,732
I mean, that's scary.
How could something like that...

366
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,276
-...just slip through the cracks?
-I don't know.

367
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:11,573
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.

368
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,160
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal...

...if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

370
00%33220,081 ==> 00333: 24,753
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

371
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,589
Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

372
O0F3838 27,7756 ~-> 004332 30,217
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

373

You hiding something?

374
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,229
I'm in. And the river card.

Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

I'm out.

you know you're in deep.

Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

379
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,625
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

380
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,462

454
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,995
Money up front.

455

Sometimes you gotta rob

Mr. Wilson
i
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,004
In closing, I can tell you...

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:08,509
..we take this very seriously.
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,886
Stopping the sale
of methamphetamines...

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,055
-..remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,226
The theft of lab equipment from your
school is also receiving our attention.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,312
Rest assured,
no stone will go unturned...

7
002002 20,521 —-> 00: 00023,.565
...in our search for the person
or persons responsible for this.

8
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,610
If you have any questions,
now would be the time. Sir.

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29, 988
You're talking like
you haven't caught anybody yet.

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,407
What about the janitor
dealing drugs at school?

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,245
There is no indication
that this individual was selling drugs.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,206
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana...

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,750
...in his car, not in the school.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,710
And he's since been fired.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,881
He had a record. I'd like to know
how he got a job here in the first place.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,716
Why wasn't there
a background check?

17
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:54,263
There was one. We're currently
reviewing our hiring policies.

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57, 933
You better be doing more. This guy
was arrested in front of my daughter.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,227
This guy was stealing
lab equipment, right?

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02, 437
That's not our thinking at this time.

21
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,857
We're looking at others, but not
limited to the maintenance staff.

 

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,278
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know when this happened?

23
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11, 947

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,450
We haven't been able to establish
a date or time. There is no sign...

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,952
...of breaking or entering.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,454
So whoever took it had a key.

27
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,958
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

28
O0#01:23,166 <-> 00: 012 27,254
Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss
details with you. What I can tell you...

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,007
...is we have good people
working hard on this case.

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,135
I'm sorry, officer,
but that just sounds like double talk.

31
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,887
We're trying to protect our children.
Level with us.

32
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,182
Really, we're giving you
all the information we have.

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,269
You know what I'd like to see
in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

34
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,315
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
locker searches and strip-searches.

35
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,319
-Our district has strict policies--
-I heard about this school in Canada...

36
00201 :50,527 ==> 00201: 58,155
...they arrested one
of the groundskeepers with drugs...

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,992
...and the next day they found out over
half the students were high on LSD.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
LSD? When were you gonna tell us
about the LSD?

39
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,750
No, please.
No one said anything about LSD.

40
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,088
What about the equipment
that's stolen?

41
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,759
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry-department locker.

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,219
And tonight we're lucky
to have someone here...

43
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,472
.to give us some specifics.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
Walt?

45
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,060
Yeah.

46
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,356
Mr. White
is currently on medical leave.

47
00802227, 564 <> 00:02: 29,733
But as he's chair
of the science department...

48
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,070
-he's made a very special effort
to be with us here.

49
00202 433,278 ==> 00202: 37,115
And I'd like to take a moment
to thank him for that.

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,127
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

51
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,713
-Please.
=Yesi,

52
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,507
Sorry.

53
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,968
And thank you.

54
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,017
The inventory list
for the missing labware is as follows:

55
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:09,398
One 5000 milliliter
round-bottom boiling flask.

56
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,152
One Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters.

57
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,239
Two full-face respirators.

58
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,243
Some CEP funnels, some head
with a thermometer holder.

59
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,837
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:40,345
Where did that come from?
And why was it so damn good?

61
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,099
Because it was illegal.

62
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,182
The basement.
Unfinished, of course.

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,270
But just look at all this space.
You gotta think rec room, media room.

64
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,523
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

65
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,360
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighborhood.

66
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,990
Big lawns and shade trees,
walking distance to the country club.

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
What happened there?

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,296
Bit of a fixer,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
but this house has great bones.

69
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,387
Know what? We're zeroing in. I've got
another listing, new, around the corner.

70
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,806
-Yeah?
~Yeah.

71

00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,433
-Hi..
-Hi.

72
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,939
-It's by appointment only.
-Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,569
He's in the recreational vehicle.

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,036
Yo, it's appointment only.

75
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41, 967
How are you feeling?

76
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:51,226
About as good as you look.
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

77
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,396
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

78
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,774
Yeah, Skinny Pete
said you wanted Tuco's address.

79
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,610
Acting like you're all out for blood.

80

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,406
But you are alive.
Obviously you wised up.

81
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,284
-No, I did go see him.
“Bullshit.

82
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,453
-So, what, are you selling your house?
-I got two dudes...

83
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,790
...that turned into raspberry slushy
and flushed down my toilet.

84
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,334
I can't even
take a proper dump in there.

85
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,005
I mean, the whole damn house
has gotta be haunted by now.

86
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,466
You didn't actually go see Tuco.

87
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,052
Here.

88
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:33,268
That is 17,500.
Your half of the 35,000.

89
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,856
Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours. You've earned it.

90
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,609
-You got this money from Tuco?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43, 653

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
So Tuco gave you this,
is what you're saying.

92
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,905
Well, we made a deal.

93
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,532
-You made a deal?
-That's right.

94
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,828
How--? Why would you
make a deal with that scumbag?

95
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54, 331
-You see what he did to me?
-Because I think...

96
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,168
...that we can do business together.
We came to an understanding.

97
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00, 629
No way, man.
Okay? No understanding.

98
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,839
Take a look
at the money in your hand.

99
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,593
Now, just imagine
making that every week.

100
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:11,431
That's avkght..

Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.

101
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,729
Without even talking to me
you told this insane ass-clown...

102
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,316

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...-dead-eyed killer that--

103
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,360
That we would
give him 2 pounds a week.

104
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,196

We'll just scale up our operation,

add a few more hours.

105
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,031

No, don't talk to me about hours.

-The

106
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,451
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

107
00207:31,660 => 00:07: 35,413
You think the meth fairy's
just gonna bring it to us?

108
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,041
God, it takes me a week
to get this stuff.

09

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,293
I'm driving

all the way to Las Cruces...

10
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,505
...200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs.

 

11
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,675
-Smurfs?

dudes who go to the drugstores...

A2
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,761

-and get a couple boxes at a time

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

and then sell them to me.

113
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52, 847
That's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

114
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:57,060
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

15
00207 257,268 ==> 00207: 58,311
All right.

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,940
Of course, you would've known
that if you would've just asked me.

able
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,445
-Well, here we are again.
-Here we are.

118
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,280
-Skyler, you look great.
-Thank you.

119
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,866
You must be, what, six, seven months?

120

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,245
-How goes it?

-It's great.

121
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,165
Other than waddling
to the bathroom every five minutes.

 

122
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,501
The baby shower is next week.

123:
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,753
And it'll be good to....

124
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,549
It'll be good to have a day
that's just about Skyler.

125)

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,634
Very nice.

126
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,095
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

127
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,099
-Walt, I see you committed to hair loss.
-Yeah.

128
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,643
-How do you feel?
-Okay.

29
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,188
I-- You know, pretty decent, actually.

30

00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,650
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

31
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,363
And he's even more physical.

32
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,032
More physical?

33
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,368
Well, sexual.

 

34
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,583
Frisky, actually. I mean,
that's gotta be a good sign, right?

135
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,919
-Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
-Right.

136
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,547
Couldn't that mean
that the chemo is working?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
137
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,801
Well, realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the antiemetics tuned right.

138
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,929
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo...

139
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,349
...and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

140
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,144
Well, isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

141
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,439
I've been wondering
about alternative medicine.

142
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,984
I mean, Eastern healing.

143
00#09%.26,193 => 00:09: 32,363
-You know, holistic.

It doesn't make any real difference.

Having a better outlook

that we manage our expectations.

00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:46,222
Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.

304
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,267
Cocaine? Heroin?

305
002213515602 == 002245 54,021
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

306
O0e21355,.397 => 00221259777
Well, you ought to visit lockup.
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.

 

 

307
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,656
"Hey, man, what, you busting me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

308
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,410
It's all going to be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

309

Say it, buddy.

310
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,248
It don't only go one way either.

311
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,793
I mean, some other stuff is legal
that shouldn't be.

312
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,256
I mean,
frigging meth used to be legal.

Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

314
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,346
Thank God they came to their senses
on that one, huh?

315
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,643
Yeah.

316
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,276
Okay.

317
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,783
Nice party.

318
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,205
A tiara.

 

319
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:58,043
A white-gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

320
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:03,424
Yeah. You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.

321
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,972
I mean, that thing must've cost,
like, what, 5 or 600 dollars.

322
00223212,390 --> 00:23:14,977
You know, I think I'm gonna return it.

323
002233 15,185 -<> 0032317, 771
Are you sure?
She's bound to find out.

324
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,067
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie...

00223522,276 == 002235 27,156
..-more than a white-gold baby tiara.

326
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,243
Hey. You know, I've been thinking...

327
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,747
...about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

328
00:23:34,955 =-> 00:23:37,374
No. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mention that anymore.

329
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,004
No, no, no. What I mean is that
maybe there is something to it.

330
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:49,803
Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

331
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,849
Healing ceremony. It's supposed
to be good for your lungs.

332
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,393
I'm not saying that I believe in it...

333
002232 59,021. > 00:24:02,104
..-but it might be an experience.

334
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,984
Really.

335
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,903
You?

336
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,404

I was thinking about driving up
on Friday, coming back Sunday.

338
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,829
-I mean, if you're okay with it.
-Well, of course I'm okay with that.

33:9
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17, 623
Okay.

340
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,592
-Sweat lodge?
-Yeah.

341
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,261
I'm already sweating. Help me out.

342
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,181
Okay.

343
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,308
Hey.

344
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,396
70 millimeter tube furnace. Excellent.

345
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,815
-This is excellent. Good work.
-Damn straight.

346
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,985
Okay, hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced, yes?

347
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,028
Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this--

348
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,782
This crap wasn't easy to get.
And it's expensive.

349

Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

350
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,619
I don't see the methylamine.

351
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,707
Yeah, well,
that's where I ran into some trouble.

35.2
00224:59,915 => 00:25: 01,333
What kind of trouble?

353
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,711
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

354
00225: 03,919 => 00:25:07,047
But this methylamine....

355
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,634
Not so easy.
I mean, they got it locked down tight.

356
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,013
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

357
00:25:14,221, => 00:25:17,057
But they want 10 grand.

358
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,059
What's the problem?

You have the money.

 

 

B59.
002252 159,268 => 00:25: 21,812
No, had.

I spent almost the whole wad.

360
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:26,233
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,404
So these thieves, did they say
where they would be stealing it from?

362
00225: 30,612 =-—> 00:25: 33,323
A chemical supply place,
south of town.

363
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,578
They got guards and security cameras.
They got steel doors.

364
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,123
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

365
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,958
What?

366
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,601
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

367
00#26:01,977 => 00:26: 03,479
Yeah?

368
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,898
How we gonna do that?

369
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,942
With this.

370
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,416
So, what's this stuff called again?

371
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,296
Thermite.

372
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,715
And that will cut through a lock?

373

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,551
Because this is supposed to be
one big-ass lock.

374
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,262
In World War II...

38715
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:41,433
...the Germans had an artillery piece--
It's the biggest in the world.

376
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,560
--called the Gustav Gun.

377
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,313
And it weighed a thousand tons.

378
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,818
And the Gustav
was capable of firing a 7-ton shell...

379
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,531
...and hitting a target,
accurately, 23 miles away.

380
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00, 828
I mean, you could drop bombs on it
every day for a month...

381
00227:01,036 <-> 00:27:03,497
...without ever disabling it.

382
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,374
But...

383
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,543
...drop a commando...

384
00227207, 751, --> 00;27% 11,922

00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,094

melt right through
solid steel...

Look, I--
I've never stolen anything in my life.

405
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,958
All right?
I told you, that tiara was a gift--

406
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,420
-A baby-shower gift.
-So who gave it to you, then?

407
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,092
-I don't have to tell you that.
-You don't have to tell me anything.

...Showing this particular item
to a tall blond woman...

411
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,270

walked right out the door with it.

-So there.
-Oh, yeah?

-Billy, you back from the crapper yet?
-Let me out of here.

466
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,935
-I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
-The alarm's going off. Check it out.

467
00232:59,144 => 00:33:01,021

-Come on, let me try.
-How is it gonna be any different?

471
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,752
-Can I just try it?
-Fine, go ahead.

472
00:33:23,960 =-> 00:33:26,379
Jesus. Okay.

473
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,590
All right.

474
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,433
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.

475
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,310
-Yeah, okay.
-I'm the king.

476
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:46,107
No. No, no. That didn't sound good.

477
002332 49,110 => 00:33: 50, 612
Oh, God.

478
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,573
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

479
00333:53,782 =-> 00:33:57,494
We're not cooking
in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.

What part of "slow it down"
did you not understand?

482
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:11,466
What are you talking--? I'm--
It's heavy, man. It got away from me.

483
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,719
Okay. All right.
Now, that's good, that's good.

484
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,013
Now just bring it up, bring it up.

485
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,308
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

486
002344205 767 ==> 0073.4: 23,979
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

487
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,564
Oh, shit.

488
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,108
Yeah. I don't know.

489
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,943
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

490
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,990
Good call, yo.

491
002352 07,981. <-> 0033.5: 10, 734
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

492

4.5 pounds.

Four and a half, not 4?

495
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,662
Two pounds pays Tuco back.

496
00235:.23,163 ==> 00:35: 27,334
Four and a half pounds
puts us $44,000 ahead.

-Right on, man.

With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night...

..we can make
4.5 pounds a week for....

501

Well, for the foreseeable future.

502
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,517
How long is that gonna be?

503
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48, 813
I mean, in your situation.

504
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,483
How much cash do you need?

More.

Someone's in the yard.

507
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,373
Yeah, this is definitely the one.

508
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,916
It's pretty.

509
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,169
Actually, I like it.

510
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,380
We could pull that out

and put in a closet.

511

00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16, 383
Just a little--

We'll have to bring that down.

 

512
00386: 17,133 —-> 00:36219,344
I thought you didn't like
that type of thing.

513

Oh, no. No, I don't.

514
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,724
Right, right.

 

515
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,692
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon, an open house?

516
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,362
-I left her a message. It's not my fault.
-I don't care how you do it...

517
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,864

-All right, go.

Absolutely.

You know, you can't duck me forever.

521
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,649
What?

522
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,068
Come on, I left you, like,
15 messages.

523
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,738
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back.

524
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,824
I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.

525
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,034
Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

526
00237 $25,243 ==" 00237: 29,539
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

527

That--

528
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,170
That tiara.

529
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:39,382
They accused me, at Zachary's,

of shoplifting it.

530
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,051
What were you doing at Zachary's?

531
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,679
I was returning it.

532
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,766
You were returning it.

533
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,934
Why would you return it?

534
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,520
It just wasn't--

535
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:56,775
Marie, what is wrong with you?
Can you please tell me that?

536
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,111
Can you tell me
why you'd do such a thing?

537
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,534
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

538
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:13,833
That...means that I have no idea
what the hell you're even talking about.

539.
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,045
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

540
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,838
The shop--

541
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,884

You're not going to admit this,
are you?

00238:29,307 +=> 00:38 32,352
I can't really admit to something...

544
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,439
..when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

You're right.

549
00239:10,265 --> 00:39:12,559
Look at this wall here.

550
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,406
Excuse me,
I'd just like to see the basement.

551
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,826
-Yeah, well, it's occupied.
-It's not a bathroom.

552
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,204
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.

You got that? Is that sinking in?
Now, beat it.

555
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,670
All you all, house is not for sale.

556

-Hey.
-Hey.

558
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,260
So how was it?

559
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:33,598
Was it an experience?

560
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,224
Yeah.

561
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,353
It was definitely an experience.

562
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,902
What's that smell?

563
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,989
Oh, yeah, it's...

564

No.

Not really.

569

215,723 --> 00:41:17,934

Actually, not at all.

I mean,

-Yeah.

ll, she stole it. Yep.

I practically got arrested
to return it at the store.

Oh,

my God.

574

She refuses to apologize.

I don't know what to do.

People sometimes

People sometimes
do things for their families?

578

00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,436

And what, that justifies stealing?

579

Well....

580
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,359
That must've been
some sweat lodge.

581
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,655
Are you even listening to the words
coming out of your mouth?

582
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,911
What would you do if it were me?

What do you mean, if it were you?

If it were me, what would you do?
Would you divorce me?

585
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,549
Would you turn me in to the police?

586
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,144
You don't want to find out.

587
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,574
You want something to eat?

00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,288
No, thanks.

589
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,474
What is this shit? This is blue.

590
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,896

but it is every bit as pure.

Tight, tight, tight, yeah.

593

And what'd I say, man?
This guy can cook.

597
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,144
You're all right, man. You're all right.

598
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,980
We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

599
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,900
Just remember
who you're working for.

600
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,280
What did you say?

601
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,449
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

602
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,202
Like they don't already know that?

No, I'm just-- I'm just saying.

605
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,296
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid.

606
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,090
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

No, come on, Tuco. I'm just--
I'm just saying.

608
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,220
No, you're just speaking for me!

609
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,683
Like I ain't got the goddamn sense
to speak for myself!

610
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,312
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

611
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,230
Tuco.

Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?
