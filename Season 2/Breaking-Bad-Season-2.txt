00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,276
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54, 323
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

2
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,701
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,337
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,299
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,394
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,315
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,819
What did you say?

9
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,864
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

0
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,617
Like they don't already know that?

al.
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,496
Are you saying that they're stupid?

2
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,874
No, I'm just saying.

8
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,183
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?
9
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,360
Heisenberg says relax.
20
00203315,1712 ==> 00303: 18,365

 

I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--
21
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,213

Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,510
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45, 308
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,489
Adjusting for inflation....

25
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,408
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

26
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,118
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:51,333
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,545
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,841
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,845

Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities...

31
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,097
»..Say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,851
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,857
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:21,613
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,741
Seven thirty-seven.

36
OOSO52 27,077 --> 0OF05s 29,871
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,416

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
That is what I need.

38
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,962
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,006
That's only 10 and a half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,761
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,141
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00#06:13,957 => 00:06:16,585
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,352
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,986
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,322
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,867
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,744
-Oh, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

48
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,247
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,917
-Do something.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Do something?

50
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,502
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,047
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,590
Do that-- Do that thing.

53
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,138
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

54
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,681
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,225
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,146
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,860
No.

58
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,144
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,480
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,482
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,573
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62

00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,660
That sounds like arguing.

63

00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,989

Gonzo, hurry up.

64

00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,761

What's the big hurry?

65

00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,352

I just think we're done here.

66

00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,480

Oh, yeah?

67

00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120

Walt?
76
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,244
Didn't you hear me?
77
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,289
Walt.
78
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,630
Walt.
79
00: 254,547 --> 00: 756,966
-Hey.

-Hey yourself.

80
OO#1LL: Styl 7S <> 00s 1L1e 59,,:4.69
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,308
Are you okay?

82
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,727
Great.

83
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,275
New hat?

84
00212 $16,653 ==— 00212: 18,321
Yeah.

85
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,242
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,285

Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

 

 

87
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,373
But they can occasionally adapt

to other local areas...

88
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,126
-like airports, golf courses--

89
00%12747,183 ==> 00312: 49,352
Where've you been?

90
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,259
What is...?

91
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,390
What are you doing?

92
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,642
Okay.

93
008134 30,685 ==> 003138 32,937
You know what?

I've got all this crap on my face.

 

 

94
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,148
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
002133 35,356 ==" 00213: 39,360
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so....

96
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,488
Okay. Yeah, just.

97
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,158
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,453
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,788
Stop: it!

100
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,592

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:50,098
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

02
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:56,145
But you cannot take it out on me.

03
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,029
Hey, I'm home.

04
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,105
Oh, we are dead.

05
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,733
Dead, man.

 

06
00216323,941 ==~ 00216: 26,527
Ruto or rute

or however the hell you--

 

107
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,571
-This is conjecture.
-This is conjecture?

 

108
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30, 698
-Conjecture isn't helping.
-Conjecture--?

109
00216: 30,907 ==> 00916234, 285
-We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37, 622
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

112

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,126

-I saw that Caddy of his

cruising my neighborhood.

113

00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,754

If he wanted

he

00:

What is that,

 

 

00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:51,344
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?
116
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,973
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?
117
O0216356,782 ==> 00216: 59,018
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...
118
00216: 59,227 = 00s17s 02,813
..Saying, "You're done."
119
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,065
"You're done"?
120
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06, 943
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.
121
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09, 987

exactly how it sounds,

to kill us,

would've at the junkyard.

114
--> 00:16:47,507
conjecture?

6:44, 962

 

115

 

That means
yo.

122

00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,740
All right. We are witnesses.

We are loose ends.

123

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,159

Right now,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

Tuco's thinking,
“Yeah, hey...

124
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,872
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,378
What happens when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,388
No.

127
00217:35,596 =-> 00217: 38,349
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,487
-How would you do it?
-What do you mean, how?

29
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,241
Specifically, how would you do it?

Step by step.

30
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,412
All right.
31

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,415
Say we set up one last sale.

 

32
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,835
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

 

133
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,338
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,801
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,887
So three shots?

136
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,808
-Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,394
-Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,021
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,691
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

40
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,529
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

41
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,781
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

42
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,075
-...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

 

43
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,453
-You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him--

144
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,455
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,040
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,083
-I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
147
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,045
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,838
Now, is there anyone else there?

149

00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,259
mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150

00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:00,056

Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

 

51
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,727
All right.
52

00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,189
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

53
00219: 08,397 => 00:19: 10,358
At this point, how many shots fired?

 

54
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,611
You've gotta be running low.

How many bullets does that gun take?

 

 

155
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,489
Well, let me see.

156
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,576
It's not--

157
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,089
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

158
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,966
...and you can't even open the gun?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
159
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,474
-It's not that easy, is it?
-Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

160
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,439

I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

173
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:48,914
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

174
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:54,128
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

175
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,006
..with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

...and try and figure out
how to use the little knives and forks?

A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

This is them. Check this out.

Burns about 5000 degrees.

Rice and beans?

Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

It's toxic in small doses.

Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

-Don't touch them.

-Yes.

Back in the late 70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

324
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,747
Yeah.

325
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:24,419
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know....

326
00233:31,593 --> 00:33:32,802

You knew about this.

327
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,306
We're working on it.

328
002334 36,515 => 00233% 39,643
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

329.
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,729
-And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

330
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,565
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

331
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,444
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

332
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,112
I mean, we gotta, you know.

333
002332 51,321. <> 0023955,033
We gotta support the shit out of her.

334
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,036
Do we?

335
00%33258,245 ==> 00933:59,579
Yeah.

336
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,749
I need support.

337
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,752
Me.

338
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,004
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
33:9
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,006
...with the surprise baby on the way.

340
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,425
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

341
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,387
...-who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

342
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,514
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

343
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,684
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

344
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,644
And the overdrawn
checking account.

345
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,398
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

346
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,359
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

347
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,653
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

348
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,864
But, oh, I see.

349
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,659
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

350
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,412

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

351
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,331
»..-my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

352
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,459
...who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention?"

353:
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:52,632
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

354
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,234
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

355
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,310
That's all it takes?

356
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,022
That's all it takes.

357
002354 49,981 =-> 00:35:52,776
So now what?

358
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,071
Now we arrange our next meet.

359
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,615
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

360
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,867
Business as usual.

361
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,788
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

362

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:11,419
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
meth formula we've been working on.

363
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,671
Care to try it?"

364
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,632
Okay, well, what's new about it?

365)
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,968
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

366
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

367
00:36:21,513 =-> 00:36:24,474
It gets the user insanely high.

368
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,060
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

369
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,730
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

370
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,192
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

371
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:40,490
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

372
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,326
..it'll look like natural causes.

373
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,539
-What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

Or the flu, maybe.

B75
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,752
His associates won't know
any differently...

376
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,839
...and we'll be in the clear.

377
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,050
Not if Tuco kills us first.

378
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,361
Just keep it down.

379
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,697
Hey, Hank. What's up?

380
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,490
Oh, hey, buddy.

381
00237 '25,410 ==> 00237: 26,453
You been home yet?

382
O0e31227,996 --> 00:37:30,331
No. Why?

383
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,916
Well ..ss

384
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,462
Because I really screwed up.

385
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,798
I apologize in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.

386
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,843
I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.

387
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:47,182
-I should have just kept out of it.
-Yeah, well, okay.

388
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,975
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

389
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,896
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

390
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,648
Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

39.1,
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,777
Jesus, the wives, huh?

392
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,362
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

393
00#38:01,571. <-> 00:38: 05,116
Oh, yeah.

Hey, man, don't let me keep you.

394
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:10,121
Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.
395

00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,040
You wanna see something
really freaky?

396
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,543
-Well, I would, but--
-Seriously, Walt, this is....

397
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,965
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomey are at. Just a second.

Hang on.
It should be coming through right now.

400
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,063
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

401
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,818
Couple of local bulletheads.

402
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,987
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

403
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,575
Walt, you there?

404
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,371
Hey, Walt?

405
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,710
-I'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need it!

406
00238:57,919 =-> 00:39:00,505
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

407
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,842
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've....

408
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,512

I'll be ri

422
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,001

I recognize these two knobjobs.
423
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,670
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

424
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,047
...named Tuco Salamanca.

425
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,841
-Guess he got tired of associating.
-Yeah.

426
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,677
-Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
-No, go ahead.

427
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,180
Thanks.

428
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,852
The big one smells fresher.

429
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,022
You guys find a death wound?

430
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,863
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

431
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,784
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

432
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,578
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

433
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,998

We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

439

This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

440
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,580
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

441
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,126
...when the stack must have shifted.

442
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:52,755
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

443
00243252,964 <-> 00:43:57,593
-Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
-Don't you just?

444

Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

445
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,307
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43, 604
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,981
..we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,025
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,321
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
008014 52,529 ==> 00701756,'074
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,912
So study the face. Study the file.

8
0002: 01,121 =-> 00702203,498
Get a big old raging hard-on...

00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,044
«.0at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,057
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

15
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,143
..-back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,853
...from the So Cal biker gangs.

17
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,482
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,319
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,155
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

20
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,616
..of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,786
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,996
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,748
..but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,501
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.
25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,630
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
002022 52,339 =<—> 00:02: 55,050
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,094
We sure don't want it going on
up here. ws

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,054
..-which brings us to the good news.

29:
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,809
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,854
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,566
Found him tucked in the junkyard

along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,402
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00203313,610 ==> 00703: 18,073
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

34
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,659
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03420,867 --> 00:03:24,329
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

Anyway. The upshot is...

38

bloody fingerprint...

39
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,969
. which belongs to Sefior Tuco.

40
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,723
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,435
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,896
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

-Yes.

44
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,234
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45

Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,365
-Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yes!

They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20, 886
Guy's in México by now.

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,097
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,643
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,562
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,317
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,695
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,865
Damn. You don't think he...?

All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,781
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so....

63
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,119
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11, 663
Without the hair.

65
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,584
Hey, it's me.

66

00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,254

Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,882
No worries. Happy to help.

 

68
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24, 342
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26, 928
-What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

70
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,264
»..most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,894
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,938
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,399
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,944
What about

other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,447
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:50,702
-Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,704
That's fine.

78
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,748
-Is that the list of medications?
=Yesi.

79
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,542
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,379
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,090
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:14,059
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,977
Yeah.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

84
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,482
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,816
Agitated?

86
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,488
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,408
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:39,209
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,920
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,007
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47, 842
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,096
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53, 932
Nothing else missing?

94
00207:55,183 ==> 00207:259,145
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,024
But-- What about the phone call?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

96
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,569
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,657
-What phone call?
-Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,203
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,082
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

Anything else.

 

05

00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,890
No. I called

the credit card providers...

106
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,229
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,775

with every hospital within 50 miles.

So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,659
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

1
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,370
...being that you're the expert.

2
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,209
I'm sorry.

3
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,753
No worries.

 

 

4
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,715

I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115

-Mrs. White.
-Thank you.

-Walter.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,110
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,237
-And?
-Never happened.

119
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,906

00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,801
No, it's-- It's killer.

13.9
O0821<01,177 S=> 003218 02,511
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,060
So I was thinking last night.

201
00221 310,269 == 002255 11,896
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:20,821
-Mexico?

-We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

 

 

203
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,782
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00%21222,.990 => 00:21:25,493
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,620
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,997

...because I got my people there.

207
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,041
Connections.

208
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,420
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

TUCO yg. cles wussive

210
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,550
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,929
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,183
I don't want you to take

 

 

this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213

OOs 21 251,977 =--> 003217953, 979
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,692
Who's talking to you?

216
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,074
You need me, man...

 

217
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,452
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

00222 412,998 ==> 00:22:14,583
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,628
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,964
Stink or no stink...

222
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,677
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:30,307
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,852
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,896
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,485
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,281
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,284
Chili powder.

229
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,917
I hate chili powder.

230
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,966
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,304
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233:
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,903
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,990
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,200
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,704
He's my partner.

237
00%23235,039 ==> 00:23:39,043
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44, 381
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,425
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,096
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54, 642
And you....

242
00:23:55,935 =-> 00:23:58,854
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,039

00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,212
-No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.

-He wants to help, let him help.
246
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,882
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,136
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,848
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:35,099 -->
I got my cell if

00:24:37,309
you need me.

250
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,645
-Okay?
-Okay.

251
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,692
-Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

252
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:52,116
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,201
...bodes well.

254

00:24:55,285

if he-- You know.

255)
--> 00:25:03,711
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,504
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,632
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,178

-What about the second cell phone?

-Jesus.

259
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:17,016
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:18,516 =-> 00:25:20,518

Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,944
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00225329,153 ==— 00°25231,-488
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34, 408
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,702

But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,125
All right. Well, then if that's the
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,880
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

case,
267
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,175
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00%25753,677 ==> 00325: 56,889.
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,141
What does it mean?

270
002254 59,349 ==> 00226: 01,518
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,814
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,902
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,990
-Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:19,119
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,958
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00%26:25,167 => 00:26:27,585
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,130
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:40,140

-What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,351
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44, 686
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,816
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,654
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55, 948
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,243
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,454
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,376
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,169
He may know something.

288
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,428
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,432
Then grasp.

Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,990
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,576
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,704
-Why?
-I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,753
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
O0927351,.962 => 00227: 55,299
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,135
-That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,014
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,184
-Really?
-Yeah.

300
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,731
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00228:10,939 --> 00:28:13,275

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,861
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,863
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,616
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,451
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00#282.22,659 => 00:28: 25,996
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,414
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,875
Just kind of walked off, or....

309
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,337
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

310
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,215
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,133
That's terrible.

312
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,636
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,805

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son....

314
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,059
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,313
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,692
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,780
I don't necessarily. I just--

318
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,241
-Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

 

319
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,665
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,375
Oh, my God.

32.1,
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,668
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:12,876 =--> 00:29:15,337
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,048
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,801
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
325
00:29:21,009 --> 00729: 23,512
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

326
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,098
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,977
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,937
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329.
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,234
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,238
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,949
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,577
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,499
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,714
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,302
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:08, 932
If he had spent half as much time

and money on his education...

337
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,353

.. registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,831
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,585
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,172
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

you leaving my gun, huh?

I don't know.

00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,155
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,449
..who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,534
Us.

364
00232:35,245 --> 00:32:36,913
We need a plan.

365
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,377
-Think, think.
-Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,838
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,132
.».-and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,723
Crack him over the head
with something?

Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,439
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,776
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

374
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,244
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

B75
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,288
That's your point?

Yeah.

377
002332 48,151. > 00:33: 51,154
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,740
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chili P.

That much has been established.

So unless you can convince him
to booty bump....

381

Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,733
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

I don't want you to go belly up

I eat first. That's the deal.

Old people.

You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,068
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

You better eat every bite of that.

395

What did you do that for?

God!

Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

418

..-he was watching
one of those telenovels...

419
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,717
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420

not to change the channel.

Okay. That's okay.

11

03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,877
You see that?

12
04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,952
-What does he remember?
-Not a whole lot.

13
04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,996
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...
14
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,957
..-but once we gave him fluids
he stabilized pretty quickly.

15
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,292
But I mean....

16
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,879
-He knows where he is?
-Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,424
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,260
Go on in. He's probably awake.

You know who I am, right?

Yes, son. I know who you are.

32

but other than that...

What a day this has been.

36
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,121
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

37
00205: 31,081 => 00:05: 32,457
A shootout?

38
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,627
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

-Oh, my God. Is he all right?
-Absolutely fine.

41

-Where did this happen? How could--
-Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,389
We're all okay.

43
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,224
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,060
And no idea what caused it?

45
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,478
No.

46
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56, 606
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so....

47
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,861
But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?

48
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,154
I really....

49
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,909
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so....

50
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,578
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,873

Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

-Marie.
-I.... Don't get me wrong.
53

00206315,959 ==> 00706: 21,006
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,008
I just, I mean....

55
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,803
He.... Naked?
56

00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,806
He was naked.

57
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,766
Naked.

58
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,602
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,186
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,732
In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.

61
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41, 943
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,612
How's Hank?

00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,868
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,913
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

66
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,291
.they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,669
But how is he? Really?

68
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,381
Hank?

69
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,803
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,309
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,228
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

72
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,690
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,527
-He was shot previous to your arrival?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,323
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

715
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,700

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

76
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,496
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,748
I returned fire and sought cover...

78
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,043
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

719
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,880
When he paused to reload...

80
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,466
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

81
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,011
Agent Schrader...

82
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53, 682
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,601
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,396
-I was tending to another matter.
-What other matter?

85
00208:03,817 ==> 00:08:05,527
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,780
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

87
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,492
-Your brother-in-law?
-Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,412
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,580
At the time, he'd been missing
for hoursun.. .

90
00208317, 789 === 00208221, 251
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,420
I was talking to his acquaintances...

92
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25, 880
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,676
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

94
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,013
...a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,767
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,271
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45, 233
-Have you run him down yet?
-Not yet, but we're working on it.

98

Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

99

They don't give up.

100
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,586
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,089
-They need probable cause.
-Probable cause?

02
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,091
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

03
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,678
I told you, this is serious shit.

04
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15, 930
I'm like an outlaw.

05
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,307
Okay.

 

06
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,318
Let's do this.

07

You're Willy Wonka.

You are Willy Wonka,

So where you keep the pseudo?

It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

-I told you, that's why we're here.

186

No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233

You know, Funyuns.

234
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,371
I had a Hot Pocket.

235

Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236

You didn't notice your car

No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

-You weren't answering your phone.
-It was in my car.

Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

I don't know. Like this?

252

Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred

and 20 dollars.

 

 

253
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,601
That's not mine.

Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,872
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262

I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263

Tuco had a bullet in him when I got
there and you know about that too.

269
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,396
So, what are you saying?

270
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,523
I shot someone?

271
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,235
-With, like, a gun?
-You?

272
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,237
No.

273
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,615
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

274
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,910
But I think you know
the badass who did.

275

Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

276

Funyuns and boom-boom.

No.

You got penis withdrawal?

You got schlongus interruptus?

Not even for a little, little minute?

Not even for a second?

For a second? I don't know, maybe.

Maybe?

Did Jesse leave the room?

He did, didn't he?

You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

It's you. I know you.

303

-The football player.
-How about we stay on topic?

306
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,862
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307

We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308

...things you can't
get out of your head?

320
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,664
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,668
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

322

323

An ongoing process.

-Ongoing for how long?

Now...

00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:07,363
.-if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

Walt...

331
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,953
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

332
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,330
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,581
Get into a situation...

334
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,708

-where you could be shot
by the police?

 

335
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,585
We can't allow you to leave...

 

336
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,880
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,841
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

338
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,642
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

339
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,060
It's very straightforward.

340
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,647
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,148
What about my family?

342
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,652
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,487
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:53,450
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,246
And you, as a medical practitioner...

346
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,623
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

There was no fugue state.

556
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,006
I'm still here. I'm me...

557
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,551
...and we're gonna be okay.

Walt...

559.
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,980
-do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,818
A second cell phone?

561
00:44:56,027 --> 00:45:00,198
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

562
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,533
...and you were very upset.

563
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,287
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09, 332
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,752
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

566
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15, 463
...and just disappeared.

567
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,674
Yeah.

568
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,177
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

569
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24, 430
...there was no call.

570
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,351
No call on the phone I know about.

That is...

572
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,776
a awd

573
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,904
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

574
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:45,076
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,413
Okay.

00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:51,695
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,034
-What's up, brother?
“Hey, bro.

3
00:02:13,175 -->. 00:02:15,302
This is stupid.

4
00202: 15,927 =-> 00:02720,349
-You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23, 685
-So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

6
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,104
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,150
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,527
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,240
...-that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

10
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,993
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,047
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,675
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,677
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,722
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,601
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00203316,113 ==> 00203: 17,489
That's $600.

17
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,116
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,745
-Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,164
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,543
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00203329, 751, ==> 00203231,753
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,840
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:44,474
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24

00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,353
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25)
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,940
Where are you going?

26
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,943
I leave first.

27
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,256
-Walt!
-In the kitchen.

28
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,898
Hey.

29
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,235
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,739
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

Sa.
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,532
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,038
What?

33
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,043
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,796
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58, 882
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,303

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,556
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

38
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,684
..which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,022
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:18,068
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00#052.20,070 =<—> 00205221, 613
I wanted to.

42
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,785
-Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

43
002053 28,119 ==> 00:°05230,497
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,083
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
002053 34,167 =-> 00205238, 797
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,507
-Yeah.
-There you go.

47
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,218
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46, 388

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,182

No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
002053 49,391 =-> 00205252, 227
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,021
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,316
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,110
You too.

54
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,573
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,285
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,536
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

57
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,288
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,956
All right.

59
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,212
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,673
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,382
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,219

-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.

-Stop it.

63
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,598
Give me your plate.

No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,266
Thank you.

65
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,853
Hey, listen...

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,314
-in the calendar section...

67
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,983
...all week long...

68
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,487

...there's a fiction writer's seminar

at UNM.

69
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,074
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,827
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

71
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:56,875
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
72
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,878
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,475
Oh, and...

74
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,562
...-you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,106
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,817
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:28,198
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:34,871
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

719
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,208
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,337
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,341
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,678
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,556

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...-if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,851
I tried to go in

and change it to a different sound...

85
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,396

...other than the phone ring, but....

86
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,774
They so overcomplicate
these things.

87
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,405
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,741
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,787
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,082
..we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,129
Skyler?

92
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,392
Skyler?

93
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,403
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,165
Not another intervention.

Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

-It's your Aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

02

00:10:11,820
She never gave

00:10:13,530

--> 00:10:13,321
it to you, Jesse.

03
--> 00:10:16,282

You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

00:10:16,491

 

04
--> 00:10:19,744

Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105

00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23, 665
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

That was the deal.

What the hell happened?

00:10:26,501

107
=> 00210:29,1.70
What happened is

 

you're a speed manufacturer.
108
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,673
No, I'm not. What?
109
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,468
A DEA agent came
ooking for you, Jesse.
110
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,971
He came to our front door.
111
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,019
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...
112
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:49,023

...which I could get into

a lot of trouble for telling you...
3
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,192
...SO you're welcome.
4
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,611
I saw your basement.
i)
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,697
Oh, yeah.
6
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,784
I was worried, so I went
over there and let myself in...
17
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:04,414
...and I found your laboratory.

Manufacture of a Schedule II

It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125

-but you will not drag us down
with you.

Otherwise,
your parents have authorized me...

Is that clear?

302
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46, 986
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,905
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10, 634
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,929
-You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

306
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,307
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,560
Not cool.

308
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34, 880
-Morning.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,506

Hey.

Good.

Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00229:3.23,.971. => 00:29:27,099
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:27,307 =--> 00:29:29,601
Okay, let's slow down here...

...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,066
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,986
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
008293 39,194 => 00329243,1.15
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,617
Has he?

328
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,161
Good. Good. Okay.

329

Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,041
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

3.31
002293 53,250 -<> 00329::56,128
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332

Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333)
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,884
Right hand.

334
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,929
Good. Good. Okay.

002302 09,975 <-> 00: 30e12,.352
-Are you using both feet?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-Yeah.

336
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,730
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,065
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,985
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,906
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00%30725,532 ==> 00330 28,368
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31, 663
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,540
-All right.
-Okay?

343
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,548
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44, 634
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48, 680
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,099

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Okay.

347
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,686
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,314
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,316
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,984
I can't do this.

35.1
OO#3L: OL, 651. <-> 00s312 03,362
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,406
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,534
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,163
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,582
-All right.

-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,629
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

351
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,590
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
358
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,470
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,014
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,058
-Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

3161
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,602
-It's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,562
The brake. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,069
Okay.

364
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46, 488
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,199
I told you.

366
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,909
Flynn.

 

 

367
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,981
-Hands up, asshole!
“Yo, ‘yo, it's cool.

368
00233403,190 ==> 00733: 04,816
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,069
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

371
002332 11,3823 => 00:33: 13,950
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,119
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,332
-You smell like shit.
-It's a long story.

374
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,043
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

315
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,419
...750 for the repair.

376
00#33.24,628 =—> 00:33:27,923
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,844
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,471
Okay.

379
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,723
Here's the thing.

380
002334 36,932 == 00733: 38,308
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,894
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:47,108

for, like, you know, interest.

383
002334 47,317 S=> 002333 50,237
-I thought your word was your bond.
-It totally is.

384
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,115
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,661
But I will, soon.

386
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,038
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,416
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,211
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09, 923
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,677
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18, 348
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

3:92
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,892
Please, all right? I really....

393
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:26, 940

God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394

Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,009
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,928
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

397
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,556
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,059
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,110
Holy shit. How much?

I was thinking maybe...

404

Weird.

Not talking to me.

and refusing to tell me where.

433

Oh, God.

436
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:02,841

Is that why you asked me
about the....

you think that I'm being unfaithful?

-Okay.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Why?

445

-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

446
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,415
Of course, I would.

447

I'm not having an affair, okay?

Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,266
Then tell me.

466
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,353
Now.

467

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,532
Tell you what?

468
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,082
Skyler.

469
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,213
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,725
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,354
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,611
What the--?

473
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,672
-Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,383
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,012
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,016
-...kleptomaniac douchebags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,059
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

478
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,355
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,818
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11, 988
-Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,033
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,577
-I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,996
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,874
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,794
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,380
Your half?

487
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,091
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,844
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,347
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,516
Look, that is completely uncool,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
all right?

491
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,518
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,813
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,192
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,613
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:59,035
You are a pathetic junkie,

too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,830
..-Simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

497
00243423,351, ==> 00243: 24,936
Do it.

498
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,634
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,296
Want some breakfast?

1
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,818
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,570
Here at the end of round one...

3
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,031
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

4
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,368
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

5
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,412
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,374
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,418
Yeah.

8
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,545
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,298
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,384
And your hair should start
to come back.

11
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,097
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12

-I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
-Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,231
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,944
-No more--?
-No. No. Absolutely none.

5
00203:15,070 ==> 00:03:16,571
How are you two holding up?

00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19, 866
Fine.

00:03:20,033 =-> 00:03:23,202
I mean, you know, we're busy...

8
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,081
...but we're good. Absolutely.

9
00203:27,582 =-> 00:03:29,084
It's all good.

 

20
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,050
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

al.
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,136
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,805
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,833
Thank you.

24
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,012
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.
25
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,848
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,851
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,813
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,316
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,026
Okay.

30
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,030
Congratulations.

31
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,033
Thank you.

32
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,839
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,091
Can you--?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,513
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,894
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,732
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
37
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,735
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,406
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25, 617
Yeah. Okay.

40
00#05%.26,91.0 -—> 00:05:28,411
Bitch.

41
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,288
Hi.

42
00205: 33,166 =-> 00:05:34,918
Been around someone
who smokes?

43
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,378
No.

44
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,588
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,757
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

46
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:45,053
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

47
0005: 51,268 => 00:05: 56,022
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58, 942
I mean...
49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,280
..-I know it's strictly your domain,
but....

50
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,574
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,409
I'll handle it.

52
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,234
Oh, God.

53
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,320
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,572
-Dead.
-Still?

55
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,991
-Completely.
-Okay, then.

56
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,744
-Well, thanks for stopping by.
-Okay.

57
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,915
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,460
-Good.
-Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,629
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,256
No takers so far?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
61
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,801
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,429
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16, 931
-Heisenberg?
-Yeah, I know.

64
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,809
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,147
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,816
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,404
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:37,994
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,705
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

70
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,999
...in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,168
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,339

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,467
How does Albuquerque liaison...

74
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,012
.. Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,348
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,227
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

77
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,854
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

719
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,902
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

 

 

80
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,905
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,533
-I'm the whole package.
-I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00210216,699 => 00:10: 19,202
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,080
-You wanna grab lunch?
-Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

84
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,041
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,210
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,420
Schrader.

87
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,755
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88

00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,591
How you doing?

Yeah, I'm stoked too.

 

 

89
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,468
Yeah, El Paso.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,013
Here's the man.

9.1
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,227
-Hey, congratulations, Hank.
-Thanks.

92
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,292
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

 

 

93
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,711
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,547
Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,665
-Hey.
-Got some nerve coming back here.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
96
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,792
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

97
00212:30,959 =-> 00:12: 33,127
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,305
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

99
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:49,310
-and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

00
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,313
the toilet.

01
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,858
Look, like I said...

02
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,945
.-my word is my bond.

 

03
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,462
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00%13:16,629 => 00:13:19,590
-A million-five.

-Come on, yo.

 

 

105
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,010
-Your sister.
-Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26, 848
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
O0e13327,01L5 =—> 00213329,475
We could, you know, negotiate.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
108
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,982
Five hundred.

109
00213:36,149 ==> 00:13:37,483
-A month?
-A week.

110
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,446
For real?

111
0013:41,612 <-> 00:13:43,281
-See you.
-Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,700
Just hold on. Just chill.

I3
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,413
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,707
-Outside.
-Inside.

5
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,542
-Forget it.
-Man, come on.

6
00713:54,959 =-> 00:13:57,795
Your fence is too easy to climb.

 

 

7
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,548
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

118
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,719
-Come again?
-Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09, 640
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

120
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,393
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

21
00214:12,560 ==> 00:14:13,895
Yeah.

22
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,534
You selling?

23
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

24
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,546
What about that one?

25
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,010

It's Jane, right?

Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

-No. I mean, you know, it's great.

 

 

 

129
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,878
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
O0815421,045 ==> 00215723, 965
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

131

Everything's been painted.

-Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

-Then I'm currently not renting.

Dude, I got nowhere else to go.

This is: it.

And I got no game, all right?
64

I just need a chance.

Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

you can sell on your own?

217
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,695
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

218
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,115
-...but still, what choice do we have?
-First of all, there's no we.

Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,836
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00222 359,003 ==> 00923201,589
-No way.
-Then what do you suggest?

224
00723:01,755 --> 00:23:06,677
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,101
I got bills, man.

I've got left?

232
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,785
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233

Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234

I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

..-which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,385
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

237
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51, 639
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices:

238
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,892
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

239

You selling whatever you can.

241
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,111
There's a third way.

242
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,490
And what would that be?

243
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,411
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,997
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,043
So you're going to what?

246
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,420
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,674
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248

Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,516
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,936
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251,
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,189

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

to make money, right?

No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,158
Who said anything about you?

256
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,330
I don't vote for this plan.

-I rem-- Oh, I remember.

Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:20,060
That was the division of labor
when we started all this.

And that's exactly

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

how we should have kept it.

264
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,482
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

265
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,901
...Or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

266

...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,415
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,542
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

269
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,796
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,673
Yeah, damn straight.

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,884
Know why?

272
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,887

Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,532
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,868
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,663
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,540
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,959
-Porn, coz. You know?
-Jesus.

292
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,670
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

293
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,756
Yeah. So I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

Those are buck.

296
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,347
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00227 20,514 ==> 00327: 22, 683
-Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
-Yeah.

298

just a bunch of candles...

299
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,729
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,731
-It's gonna be chill.
-The ladies...

301
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,694

like, candles and shit.

302

You are going to score, big time.

All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,038
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,876
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,962
-I could kick it. It's been a while.
-Yes, yes.

307
00327:52,;129 =-->. 00;27% 54,590
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

308
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,050
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,888
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,724
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,603
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,732
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,692
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,362
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

815
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,072
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00#28:19,239 => 00:28:22,743
-Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
-Seventeen.

317

Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318

All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,679
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,098
Short me, you're out.

324

Cut it, you're out.

325

Period.

326
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,856
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,608
Understand?

328
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,444
Badger, what is this?

329
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,240
A big opportunity.

330
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,910
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,622
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

332
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,290
So bring out the product, yo.

No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,422
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,262
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,264
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,142
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

338
00#29:.259,309 => 00:29: 32,479
...there is always more.

339

Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340

Apply yourselves.

341
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,904
Hell, yeah.

342
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,115
Hell, yeah.

343
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,565
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,026
-Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, Hank.

345
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,402

It's not an armpit.

347

Oh, excuse me.

348
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,950
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00230:27,117 --> 00:30:29,536
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,123
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

35.1,
00230733,290 ==> 00:30:35,417
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:39,713
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,299
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,137
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,223
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,060
You just do your time
like a good boy...

357
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,229
...and I could see us

in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

358
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,190
...in a couple of years.

359
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:18,460
I went online to this fantastic...

..real estate website for D.C.

361
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:26,593
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,845
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,099
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
O0O#38L: 32,265 <> 00:312 34,518
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there--

365
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,900
Apologize.

366
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,654
What?

367
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:52,327
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologize.

-You know perfectly well, Marie.

-Well, obviously I don't--
-Your lies.

370
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,130
To me.

371
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,675
The shoplifting.

372
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,468
All of it.

373
00232 $08,635 ==> 00732: 13,140
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,435
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--

3715
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,478
Apologize.

376
00#32:21,898 => 00:32:23,984
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,653
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,451
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:39,749
If you don't respect me enough to
apologize, to tell me the truth, then--

380
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,677
I need my sister back.

381
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,359

-What do you want, the gory details?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,881
No, you don't.

385
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,966
Keep you up at night.

386
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:35,847
So was it scary?

387
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,600

00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,443
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

I mean, you don't think about it.

397

You stomp them down.

Criminals, like the one you....

I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

asking me about the roaches.

of them out there.

Something came up.

Something came up?

One of my guys got held up

Skinny Pete's cool.

that your guy got robbed--

Or rather you got robbed.
--but it doesn't matter.

Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,055
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

450
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,205
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,583
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,419
guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,962
so am I.

454
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,882

And you're all tucked in at night

with your precious family.

455
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,968
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,055
You've made
the division of labor very clear.

457
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,935
Yo, I mean, seriously...

458
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40, 647
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,883
Hey.

460
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,343
Sorry.

461
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,303
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,597
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,933
What you eating?

 

464
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,186
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

 

 

 

465
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,106
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,024
Did we?

467
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:30,697
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones

with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,408
I had a craving.

469
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,785
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,501
So where's Jr.?

471
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,670
Out.

472
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,215
With whom?

473
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,883
Louis.

474
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,973
Out where?

 

475
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,394
Somewhere. I don't know.

 

476
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,397
-He'll be back by 9.
-Okay.

477
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,944
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,738
Why don't you?

479
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:17,243
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,871
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,331
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,470
Great.

483
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:42,435
Perhaps you might know
something...

484
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,811
...about this.

485
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,733
Perhaps.

486
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,778
And then again...

487
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,031
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,701
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

489
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,790
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,876
-You don't wanna go down that road.
-Why would you do this?

491
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,129
-You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
-Three and a half cigarettes...

492
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,798

...won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,133
-Nothing.
-I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16, 928
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:23,101
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:29,023
Skyler, this-—
I mean, this is something that--

497
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,485
-This is so unlike you. Why--?
-Really?

498
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,612
How would you know?

499
002434 37,323 ==> 00243: 39,450
No, thank you.

500
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01, 639
Hank.

501
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,377
Jesus.

502
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,087
Yo.

503
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,099
You asked me what
I want you to do.

All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,108
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing....

22
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,485
-Did I say that?
-Because I'll go do it myself.

Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...

51
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,501
...-tonight in the steel knockout.

52
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,630
Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.

53
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,174
That's 15 easy installments.

54
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,385
And, folks, the knockout is only--

55
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,347
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

63
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,963
...Since we've offered this sword
in this set?

64
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:49,511
Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.

65
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,388
It's no wonder--

66
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54, 683
It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now--

67
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,017
What's your name?

68
00#07:56,184 => 00:07:59, 521
I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm--

00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,191
My name's Diesel.

72
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,450
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,287

Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.

75
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,837
Folks, custom pieces-—

76
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,471
Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...

77
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,932
...-but there's a reason for that.

78
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,396
Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.

79
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,233
These knives possess edges like....

80
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,329
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,917
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,756
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,929
Hey there, you three.

84
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,932
Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.

85
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:23,104
We'll be thinking about you

teaching valences and covalences....

Okay, that's all I officially remembered.

Good luck.

87
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,486
Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.

88
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,533
Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...

89
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,786
...-calling to say hello.

90
00209: 3:7,.952 => 00:09: 41,122
I'm down from Santa Fe today

and I was thinking about you both...

91
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,582
..-hoping everything's well.

92
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,877
I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...

93
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,588
...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.

94
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,965
Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.

95
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,804
-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Gretchen.

96
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,474
This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,479
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,064
We're very well, thank you.

100
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,777
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,322
...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.

102
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,407
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

03
008102 16,574 <> 00s102 19,577
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

04
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,162
That's wonderful.

05
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,209
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

 

06

00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,338
..-and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,799
I mean, he's been so adamant...

108
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,678
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and....
109

00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,681

But I have picked up the phone

about a hundred times. I just--

110
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:45,311
-What? What is it?
-I can't...

111
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,023
...-begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
--> 00:10:53,486
Walt's treatment,

00:10:50,525
The money for

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pt! Ss JUST. »
I3
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,323
It saved us.
114
00: 200,201 --> 00: 202,412
don't know if
115
00% 202,579 ==> 00% 205,373
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."
6
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,792
But it is a big deal. Yeah.
7
00: 207,959 --> 00: 211,462
To me. And to all of us.

00: 214,507 --> 00: 218,803

End of speech.

22
O0#11:27,604 <> 00s112 30,315
So do--

I hope we get to see you soon.

 

23

00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:35,403
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,450
-How about this afternoon?
-Yeah, okay.

25
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,748
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

26
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,543
...trienes, polyenes.

27

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,214

I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

 

28

00: 254,380 --> 00:11:56,466
But when you start

to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,927
...and you will...

130
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,264
..-just keep in mind
that one element...

 

 

 

131,
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
...Carbon.

132
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09, 437
Carbon is at the center of it all.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
133
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,399
There is no life without carbon.

134
00#12213,566 <> 00s122 16,110
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

135
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:23,243
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

36
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,079
Carmen is carbon.

37
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:31,251
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

38
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,462
No. Okay.
39

00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,091
I dike to think of tte...

40
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,595
I like to think that the diamond...

 

41
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,847
...and the woman

who wears it on her finger...

142

00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,268
...are both formed

from the same stuff.

 

 

143
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:54,440
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,986
That got your attention, right?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
145
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,906
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00%13203,199 ==> 00:13:07,203
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,333
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

148
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,961
..for making synthetic diamonds.

149
O0rl33 15,1cd28 ==> 001.33 17,338
I mean, this is way back in the 50s.

150
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:22,719

Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151.
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,640
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

 

 

152
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,436
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:36,607
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,032
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,537
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,675
Anyway....

157
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,013
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,765
...paid to a carbon-based man....

159
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:14,645
...for something
he made out of carbon.

60
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18, 358
It's so nice to have you back with us.

61
00%14:19,734 =<—> 00:14:22,403
You're looking great, by the way.

62

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,116
A little skinnier,

which is definitely no tragedy.

 

63

00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,578
-And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

164
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,081
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:40,505
-But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

167
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,550

Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,578

Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,665
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

192

Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

-You know who might have done it?

-I have an idea.

202
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,614
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,285
You ID them, and then together,

 

you and put a bag over their heads...

204
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:44,665
..we tie them up, drive them way

 

out into the desert, strip them naked...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

205
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:50,254
.then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,924
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,013
You with me?

208
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,143
Scorpions?

209
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,315
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,609
Yeah.

211
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,493
Nice.

Damn, Dad. Check it out.

Who is this?

 

214
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,868
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

 

215
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,204
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

 

216

-Mom.
-What? I'm just offering the choice.

217

Look at you. You're looking good.

224

Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

I know it was for me.

226
002203 29,979 === 00920233, 607

-Oh, sure.

228

-Exactly. Here's hoping.

229

-We could use some of that.
-Yeah.

Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231,

-It was a really good thing.
-You're very welcome.

232
002202 51,083 => 00:20754,.253
-We're gonna find a way to repay you.
-No, no, no.

233
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,590
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,927
You know, I hate to say it...

235
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,264
-but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,099
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,351
-You can't stay for dinner?
-I wish I could...

 

238

I have to try to beat the traffic.

-Drive safely.

I should walk her to her car. Really.

I don't even know where to begin.

434
00233226,379 =<—> 00:33: 31,760
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,890
Fuck you.

436
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,427
Hey.

437
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,017
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36, 366
Hey.

439
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,890
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,768
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,189
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,066
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,820
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00235213,987 =-> 00285215, 947
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,910
Bedtime.

446
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,208
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,841
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,926
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,804
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,641
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,674
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,301
Should I ask where you've been?

453
002363 19,386 == 0073.65 21,137
Never mind.

454
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,349
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00236525,392 ==" 0073.6: 27,268
Skyler.

456
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,820
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,915
Walt.

458
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,085
We need to talk.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
459
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,724
Just say it.

460
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,403
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:33,126
What did she say exactly?

462
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:40,467
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,512
She said something like:

464
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,934
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

465
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,731
..-but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,026
I wish you the very best."

467
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,071
And that was it.

468
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,329
Yeah.

469
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,250
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,377
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,088
I was so stunned, but....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
472
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:24,219
I called her back,
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:35,438
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:43,196
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

475
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:47,033
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

476
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,537
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,334
Walt.

478
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,045
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06, 386
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,848
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,768
I was with Gretchen.

482
00%39713,935 ==> 0033.93 17,230
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:22,986
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
484
00:39223,152 --> 00%39:26,072
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00739:26,239 --> 00:39:29,409
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

486
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,494
...and beating around the bush--

487
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:35,582
Okay, what--? Tell us what?

488
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,085
Well....

489
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,088
There was a lot of...

490
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,758
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

491
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:51,514
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

492
002392 51,681. <> 00.3.9: 53, 683
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,229
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion....

494
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03, 693
They're broke.

495
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,280
-You are kidding me.
-No.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
496
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,867
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,705
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and....

498
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,583
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

499
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,629
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

 

500
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,673
That is--

501
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,552
Jesus, that's....

502
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,307
Yeah.

503
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:50,657
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,828
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,083
Listen.

506
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,794
Not to sound selfish...

507
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:07,006
...but as far as we go...

508

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,677
...we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:17,642
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,352
Hey.

511
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:28,152
We're gonna make it. All right?

I promise.

 

 

 

512
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,321
Okay.
513:
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,917
And yet...
514
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,255
-she still drives a Bentley.
515
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:56,556

Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,904
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,825
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,828
You're designing a safe,
where you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,496
Nowhere.

520
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,624

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,918
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,254
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

523.
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:33,176
Oh, baby,

that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,678
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,890
I need ‘to.... IE need to even out.
526

00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,310
-Let me get a hit of that crystal.
-Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,811
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,023
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,152
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,196
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,784
I would appreciate an apology.

I am trying to take
the high road here.

534

Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,294
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:12,006
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15, 968
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

538
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,680
...and assist me and shut up.

You hear me, skank?

544

You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552

You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,273
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554

The state's called New Mexico

Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated

"Cause of the new drug they created

4
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:48, 966
They say the color is blue
And the quality pure

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:59,142
This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04, 481
And no one could stop it
If they wanted to

7

The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:20,163
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

 

9
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,920
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,174
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving

From way far away
They want to taste that meth

14

That blue stuff has crossed the border

Now New Mexico's
Livin' up to its name

16
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,907
Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding

17
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:43,288
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"

Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn....

25
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,774
You do know what a bond is?

26
00203:55, 819 ==> 00:03:59,197
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,576
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:07,164
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,832
No?

30
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:15,046
Chemical bonds

Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,865
What is "close"?

37
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,034
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,162
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,623
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,877
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

41
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,048
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,887
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,890
Like, all night, hard.

44
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,394
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:17,442
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit....

46
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,028
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48

The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

49
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,468
Yo. If I know you, leave a message.

50

This makes the third time.

Look, I will be leaving this phone on

Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the....

When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,158
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,868
All right.

56

57
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,059

Absolutely.

-Yeah, I have a key.

66

Look, the person who lives here...

67
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,142
..it's just very important
for me to see him.

68
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,229
-And you knocked, right?
-Yeah.

69
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,439

70

Now, if you wouldn't mind....

Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

77

-Wanna call him?
-No.

No. I--

719
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,141
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

80
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,811
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

81
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,604

Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

360
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,424
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

361
00228:37,591 +-> 00:28:42,221
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

362
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,353
I take my time, but I always win.

363

Please. It's Third World enough

He's already got some
big operation going.

He says he's mostly riding a desk.

-And he apologized profusely.

525
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,840
Cheddar, Mr. White.

526
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:30,261
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

527
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,556
Gonna own this city.

528
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,808
We're not charging enough.

529
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,436
What?

530
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,773
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

531
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,609
Simple economics.

532
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,172
Oh, hey, Ted.

533
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,507
Come on in.

534
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,635
-Looks like they got you all set up.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

535
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,846
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

536
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,056
And that's very nice.

537
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,517
hat might be a deal-breaker.

 

 

-I figured t
~Yeah.
538
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,436
Listen, Tsers «
539

 

00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24, 649
wanted to thank you
for having me back.

540

00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27, 694
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

 

541
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:35,034
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

544
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,040
Hey, how is Denise doing?

545
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,043

We split up, about a year ago.

546
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,547
I'm sorry.

547
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,092
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

548
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,886
-Together since high school.
-Yeah.

 

 

549
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,055
-I remember that.
-Anyway....

00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,142
I don't know, people change.

Yes.

552
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,229
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

553

My name is not really

Jesse Jackson.

563
44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,274
It's Jesse Pinkman.

564
44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,360
And that guy you met...

565
44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,282
...-he's not my dad.

 

566
44:27,957 --> 00:44:32,003

You're not gonna kick me out,

are you?
567
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,047
Because I actually really like it here.

568
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39, 343
I don't make it my business
what you do.

569
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,471
So long as you don't do it here.

570
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,024
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

571
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,529
Wanna see?

572
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,267
It's got that thing where the blacks...

573
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,605
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

574
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:38,152
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

SES
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,490
So it'll really rock the house.

576
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,159
But I'll, you know....

577
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:50, 623
I'll keep it way down, of course.

578

YOU «« «

3

You selling?

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,240
I don't know
what you're talking about.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,700
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,207
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42, 918

-I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,506
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,801
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,303

What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,180
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,267
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00, 602
That's yours, right?
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,771
What brown van?

5
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,107
Parked all inconspicuous.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,442
It's a cop van.

7
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,696
Yeah, another one right over there.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,116
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

 

9
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,368
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,996
Dude, I just wanna get high.

 

21
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,456
A flower van.

 

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,751
You know what you should do

is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,962
Seriously,
and I don't mean to disrespect...

 

 

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,756
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

25
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,009
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,554
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.
27
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,348
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.
28
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,767
Think about it, boys.
29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,813
All right. I'm hitting it.
30
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,441
You dudes give up that easy?
31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,693
I'm not a cop.
32
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,864
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
33
O0#01L: 55,6L6 <-> 00301257, 075
All right, you know what?
34
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,078

 

Just to show you

you're being an asshole.

00:02:00,287

35
--> 00:02:02,372

I'm blinded by white.

00:02:02,581

I was joking. Come on.

38

--> 00:02:09,921

on't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.
39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,383
I mean,
what are you complaining about?

40
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,844
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,929
Whatever, dude.

42

00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,848
'm not even sure

I wanna buy anymore.

 

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,726
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,978
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,398
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

46
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,108
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00202<30,317 ==> 003023 33,,070
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,614
I don't know.

49
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,160
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50

-That dude?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,291
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,794
True that.

54
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,464
This is so hard, you know?

55
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,761
I know.

56
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,805
It's simple.

57
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,434
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,

he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,520
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,897
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,819
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,321
-You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,657
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,493
Are you a police officer?

64
00203:21,993 --> 00:03:25,539
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,834
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,837
The price is the price, yo.

67
00203436,258 ==> 00203: 37,968
All right.

68
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,329
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,957
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,008
Albuquerque Police! You're
under arrest! Get down on the ground!

71
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,721
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach. Get on the ground!

72
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,850
-Hold it right there. Don't move.
-Stay down.

73
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,959
I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.

74
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,087
I better call Saul.

Did you know that you have rights?

79

00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,105

The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.

80
00:05:

4,314 --> 00:05:16,316
I believe that until proven guilty...

I'm just saying.

Don't think I can't smell that weed.

You better seriously hope
that airs out.

93

My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94

He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

Yeah?

96
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,577
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,331
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,209
Well, listen.

99
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,213
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

No, thanks.

You sure?

03

Well, is it cool if I burn one?

04
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,271
Maybe you'll change your mind.

05
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,569
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

06
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50, 911
Hey. What'd I say?

07

Nothing.

My 18-month chip.

Right on.

115
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,793
I respect that.

116
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,796
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45, 966

So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

 

20
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59, 688
I could really go for some Chinese.

21
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,398
No, I better hit it.

I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,057
He knows it.

128
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,976
He's done nothing but apologize.

129
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,104
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

130
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,566
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,362
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,948
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

33
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,117
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

34
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,368
And I said bye.

 

35

00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,871
And tell him

to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,707
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,667
What?
138
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,546

Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,102
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

153
00210702, 727 ==> 003103 05,271
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

154
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,192
-A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,446
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

156
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:17,283
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157

-The IEDs.
-Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,331
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

15.9
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,959
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160

Hank could win an Oscar.

00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,674
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:38,763
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

63
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,581
Baby, not now.

64

It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

Finding myself awake

his full amount.

I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

228

...so he's probably still in the sack.

229
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,517
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

00219: 48,854 => 00:19: 51,273
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

277
002-193 51.,482 => 00:19:53,275
You guys get younger every--

278
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,152
What'd you say to baby face?

279
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,779
Did you say anything stupid?

280
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,031
By “anything stupid,"
mean anything at all.

 

281
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,701
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

 

282
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,203
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,665
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

284
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,042
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

285
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,004
Go grab a juice box.
ave a nap. Go on.

286
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,551
All right.

287
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,470
Who do we have?

 

288
00220722, 138 ==> 00:20:23,389
Brandon Mayhew.

289
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,892
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

290
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,478
Brandon Mayhew.

291
00220732,398 --> 00:20:35,276
-Here we go. Public masturbation.
-What?

292
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,362
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

2:93
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,199
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

294
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,910
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

295

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,037
That ain't me, man. I....

296
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:52,001
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

297
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,087
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

298
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,465
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

299
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,259
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

300
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,387
Yeah, and felony quantity.

301
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,890

-Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

302
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,143
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

 

 

303
00:21:09,351 =-> 00:21:11,270
But good luck arguing that in court.

304
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,148
Let me get down to brass tacks.

305

00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,066
'm gonna get you

a second phone call.

306

00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,319
You're gonna call

your mommy or your daddy...

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
307
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,905
...Or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

308
O0821<421,113 ==> 003213 24,200
...and they're gonna
deliver me a check for $4650.

309
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,077
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

310
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,789
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

311
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:34,126
And I need that in a cashier's check
or a money order, doesn't matter.

312
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,796
Actually, I want it in a money order.

313
00821: 37,004 <> 00s212 39, Tov
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

314
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,426
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

315
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,678
It's done just for tax purposes.

316

00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,431
And after that,

we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

317
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,519
..-but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

 

318
00221:51,727 =-> 00:21352,770

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Any questions?

319
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,691
You're gonna get me off, right?

320
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,613
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

321
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,450
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

322
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,454
Son, I promise you this.

323
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,791
I will give you
the best criminal defense...

324
00222:13,;999 =--> 00322: 15,376
...that money can buy.

325
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,463
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

326
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,382
Didn't I take these already?

327
00322:21,590 =-> 00:22:24,593
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

328
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,679
It's bad for the liver.

32:9)
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,348
Okay, who's next?

330
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,810
Did him. I did him.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

331
0022233,018 --> 00422: 35,312
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

332
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,566
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

333
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,651
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

334
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,614
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

335
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,450
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

336
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,787
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

337
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,789
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

338
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,750
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

339
00322:56,959 --> 00:22:59,837
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

340
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,173
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

341
002232177271, =-> 00°2319,237
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

342

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00223319,440 ==> 00:23:21,775
You want your exponential growth...

343
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,069
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

344
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,156
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

345
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,033
This is who he hires?

346
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,202
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

347
00%234338,662 => 00:23:35,331
This is the guy I'd hire.

348
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,458
It's the guy you'd hire.

349
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,001
Look, you remember Emilio?

350
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,338
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

351
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:47,092
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

352
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,469
Dude is like Houdini.

353
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,471
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

354

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00223450,679 ==> 002233 52,514
-you don't want a criminal lawyer.

355
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,060
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

356
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,103
Know what I'm saying?

357
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,774
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

358
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,234
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

359
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,444
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

360
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,908
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

361
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,910
And it's only his first dealing rap...

362
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,746
...SO, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

363
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,457
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

364
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,588
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

365
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,341
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

366
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,636
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

367
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,304
Dick.

368
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,056
Fine.

369
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,226
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

370
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,478
Heads.

371
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,662
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

372
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,469
Mr. Mayhew.

373
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,681
Nice of you to come down. Please.

374
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,099
Look at you.

375
00825417 ,.515 S=> 0092.53 21,311
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

 

376
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,688
Joking.

377
00225422,896 =-> 00:25:24, 982
I-- Please, come on.

378

Come on. Please.

00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,406
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

381
00225234,992 --> 00725: 39,872
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

382
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,920
I believe you have
something for me?

383
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,547
Oh, yes.

384
00:25:52,134 =-> 00:25:56,472
-Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
-Tvisn.

385

Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

386
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,102
My real name is McGill.

387
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,562
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

388
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,817
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

389
00126409,359 =-m 00:26:12,237
I digress.
Good things are happening.

390
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:16,283
Fact is, your nephew is gonna

get out in no time.

391
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,118
That's wonderful, yeah.

392
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,704
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

393
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,915
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

394
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,794
..-I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

395
00226:27,002 =-> 00:26:30,380
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

396
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,216
-Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

397
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,053
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

398
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,225
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

399
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44, 937
...-but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

400
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,188
I understand that.

401
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,190
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
402
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,942
They're after some mystery man...

403
00226: 50,150 =<“ 00:26:52, 653
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

404
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,072
They want this guy
like the ax wants the turkey.

405
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,241
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

406
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,326
..that could lead to his arrest.

407
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01, 829
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

408
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,622
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

409
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,750
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

410
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,088
Wait, wait. Look, I just.... I think....
411

00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,426
I just think that we should
review our options.

412
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,053
Options?

413
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,264

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

414
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,059
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

415
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,436
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

416
00227:26,644 => 00:27:29,273
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

417
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,110
Look, look. What about reprisals?

418
00227733,3818 ==> 003274535,112
I mean, if Badger--

419
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,826
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg....

420
00227: 41,285 ==> 00927242, 953
I mean, what if, God forbid...

421
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:47,958
...that they decide to take revenge?

422
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,002
What have you been telling him?

423
00227:50,210 =-—> 00:27:53,589
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"Tf I talk, they'll kill me."

424
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,717
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

425

002274575675 == 002285 00,596
-Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terrible.

426
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,891
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

427
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,768
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

428
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,979
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

429
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,816
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

430
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,988
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

431
00#28218,197 => 00:28: 21,,\699
..-by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

432
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,329
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

433
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,999
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

434
00#28:.29,208 => 00:28: 31,793
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

435
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,504
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,719
..-all's right with the world.

438
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,932
Ten thousand dollars.

439
00#28:58,570 => 00:29: 01,365
Ten thousand, cash to you.

440
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,245
I'm not saying to throw the case.

441
00229:06,453 =-> 00:29:11,375
Just no talking to the DEA.

442
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,920
Are you saying
what think you're saying?

443
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,089
Yess

444
009293 17,923 => 00229319, 758
What's it going to be?

 

445
00229%22,135 ==> 00929224,.513
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

446
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,641
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

447
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,518
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

448
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,144
Threatened to call the police.

00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:36,358
-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the Exxon Valdez.

450
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,486
So, what do we do about it?

451
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,165
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

452
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,417
No.

453
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,294
For safety.

454
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,087
What?

455
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,842
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

456
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,023
Talk to me. Come on, talk to me, guys.
I don't know--

457
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,901
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

458
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,196
Oh, no, no, no!

459
00230%23,405 ==> 00930226,.325
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

460

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,627
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

463
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,756
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

464

00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,468
-Who?

-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

465
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,262
Oh, I thought....

466
00:30:48,221 =--> 00:30:50,390
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

467
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,018
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

468
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:57,314
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

469
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,066
You should have taken it.

470
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,361
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

471
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04, 988
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

472
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07, 699
The uncle. That was your guy?

473
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,703
No offense, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

474
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,206
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

475
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,835
-But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

476
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,964
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

477
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,883
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

478
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,177
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

479
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,679
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

480
00231:29,888 => 00231: 32,933
All right, listen to me very carefully.

481
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,018
You are going to give

Badger Mayhew...

 

 

482
00231:335,227 =-> 00:31338,355
...the best legal representation ever.

483
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,816

484
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44, 694

All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

485
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,489
If he does, you're dead.

486
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,868
Why don't you just kill Badger?

487

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,666

I mean, follow me, but

if a mosquito is buzzing around you...

488
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,086
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

 

489
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,714
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

490
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,301
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

491
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,930
-We're not killing Badger, yo.
-Then you got real problems, okay.

492
00#32212,139 => 00:32: 14,182
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

493
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,268
-like a proverbial ton of bricks.

494
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,520
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

497

Mr. Mayhew?

498
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,498
Recognize your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

499
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,417
Go on.

500

-God.
-Take it easy.

501

Breathe in, breathe out.

502
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,141
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

503
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,727
That's better.

504

Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

505

Yeah? How?

506

First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

-Go on.
-Be smart.

Just do it.

Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table....

And we're sure of that?

525

No shanking!

The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

It's just a matter of who.

529.

Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

You don't give us

Okay, let's start with a name.

He just goes by Heisenberg.

Heisenberg, huh?

541
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18, 366
How old is this Heisenberg?

542
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,829
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

 

543

Medium height, medium weight.

-What color hair?
-No hair.

Dude is balder than you.

1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

Better known as Jimmy In-and-Out.

For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

558

On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

559
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,217
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

560
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,844
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

561

Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

562

use his talents to turn a profit.

-It's already happening.

The buy is set for tomorrow.

565

Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

566

...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

569
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,716
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

570
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,718
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

571
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03, 430
...there'll be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

572
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,266
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

573
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,519
-You get 50? For what?
-For facilitating.

574
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,397
Who's taking a bigger risk here?

He likes prison.

575
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,607
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

576
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,902
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

No, man, I think we're good.

he's gonna throw up.

586
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,040

00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,953
Let's see the exchange.

599
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,750
No, no. Oh, shit!

600
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,087
-What?
-Now he shows.

601
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,509
Okay, let's do this.

602
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,973
No, no.
603
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,726
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

604
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,020
We are screwed!

605
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,605
What are you doing?

606
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,982
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,905
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

608
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,958
Where's the stuff, man?

609
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,294
-Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

610
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,259
Get out. Go stop him.

611
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,970
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

612
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,680
Get out. I'll do something.

613
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,933
-What?
-Just go!

614
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,948
Hank, I thought that was you.

Schrader, I'm blocked.

616
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,702
-Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

617
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,954
Schrader, I'm blocked.

618
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58, 623
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

619
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,168
-Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

620
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,462
Is something going down?

621
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,258
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

622
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,183
Walt, Walt.

623

00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,477
-Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

624
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,521
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

625

O0s41:21, 729 => 00241224,565
-We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

 

626
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,275
-Go that way.
-Forward is better?

Okay, okay.

628
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,822

I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

Oh,

629
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,658
-I'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

630
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,245
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

631
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,458
wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

632
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,093
-Looks like it's going down.
-Take him.

633
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,146
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

634
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06, 941
Come on, get him up.

635
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,453
Jesus!

636
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,289
I think they bought it.

637
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,044
Absolutely.

638
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29, 630
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

639
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,383
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

640
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:37,346
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

641
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,769
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

642
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,838
Hey.

643

00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,300
You weren't home,

so I let the delivery guys in.

644
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,970
-I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

 

645
00243227,3813 => 00343: 29,524
So you bought a bed.

646
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,068
Yeah.

647
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,403
What is that, a king?

648
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,491
Pillow top?

649
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18, 614
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

650
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,079

You mind?

651

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00244 429,125 ==> 00244: 31,335
I was terrible at chemistry.

652
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,172
I'm more of a humanities guy.

653
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,966
-How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

654
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:41,512
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

655
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43, 347
My PI charged me for three hours...

656
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,517
...SoO I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

657
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,565
So this is what, blackmail?

658
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54, 483
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

659
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:59,113
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

660
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01, 866
I'm not in the shake down racket.

661
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04, 493
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

662
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,872
Especially drug dealers.

663
00245:08,247 =-> 00:45:12,335

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

664
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,172
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

665
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,383
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

666
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:23,888
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

667
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,099
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

668
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,601
-but he won't be the last.

669
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,313
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

670
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,940
I don't understand.

671
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,026
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

672
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,614
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

673
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,076
I'm no Vito Corleone.

674
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,037
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

675
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,746
But with some sound advice...

676
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,333
..and the proper introductions,
who knows?

677
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,543
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

678
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,463
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

679
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59, 340
...you're on to something special.

680
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,970
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

681
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,556
Food for thought, yeah?

682
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,441
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

683
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,820
..."Better call Saul!"

00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,445
These people.

2
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:29, 988
Pathetic.
3

00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,159
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36, 328
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,790
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,376
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,170
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,090
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,386
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,056
Yeah, it's a PET/CT.

AL.
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,725
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,312
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

209,570

I just still don't understand

 

 

why you don't go to Kleinman.
15
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,405
This is where Walt's doctor is.
16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,324
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...
17
00:0 4,533 --> 00:01:16,285
.to get the results.
18
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,454
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.
19
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,248
I could take one look at Walt's...
20
002013 21,665 ==> 002013 23,792
-and tell you immediately
how he's doing.
21
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,795
-Really.

 

 

-Doctors like people to think...

22
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,465
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:30,674

--> 00:01:34,803

...but you would be surprised

how much they come to us

24

for input.

00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,352

Well, never turn down

to hit the bathroom,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

a chance
huh?
25
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,605
Excuse me.

26
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,743
You all right in there?

27
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,787
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,126
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,878
Yes.

30
008022 10,213 =“ 00s022 12,299
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,576
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:44,873
-So how'd we do?
-You did fine.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,212
-See anything?
-I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,256
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,925
Sorry.

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,717
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
37
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,512
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,390
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,561
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,813
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,315
Weeks.

42
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,151
Maybe.

43
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,777
Sorry to hear it.

44
00203355,986 ==> 00703: 59, 656
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,617
Oh, well.

Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,537
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,875
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,336
How long you been doing this?

49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,798
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,467
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:24,014
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,768
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

53
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,146
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34, 983
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,737
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,323
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44, 826
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,085
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,631
You know,

get our minds off the test results.

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,344
Actually, I....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
61
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,016
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,148
-Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,819
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:21,238 =-> 00:05:25,992
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,707
God, Walt.

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,795
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,382
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,471

...-but positive doesn't change facts,

all right?

Tbe «9 0

71
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,142
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,727
I know.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

73
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,314
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00205: 56,523 => 00:05: 58,'650
You know, forgive me.

prepare for that.

So romantic.

Yup, we're going. Get up.

A bed?

-Separate rooms.

-Yeah, that's a given.

What the hell?

243

What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,682
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,517
..where did you put them?

246
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,397
-I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,774
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248

-The buzzer didn't buzz.
-The what?

249
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,070
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

251

I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,326
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,413
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,790
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,584

Is this just a genetic thing with you?

Is it congenital?

256
00#20210,793 => 00:20:13,504
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257

The buzzer did not buzz.

258
002207315,047 ==> 00:20:17,133
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259

Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,846
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,018
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,604

No, big arrows, giant arrows.

They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,603
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320

mountain biking...

Oh, man.

We're getting really freaked out.

342

All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,655
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

There's no river.

00233: 39,976

All right,

first off,

everything you did,

you did for your family.
411
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,276
Right?

412
00233: 50,237 ==> 00:33: 53,114
All I ever managed to do...

413
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,660
-was worry and disappoint them...

414
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,204
-and lie.

415
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, God.

416
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,126
All the lies.

417
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,797
I can't even....

418
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,092
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

 

419
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,887
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,724
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,229
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,692
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,697
Your body...

424

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,784
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,081
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,750
And when they're gone...

427
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,796
-your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:56,052
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:34:56,261 --> 00:35:00,265
You go marching out there...

430
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:04,352
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

431
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:08, 648
Okay, you need to cut out

all your loser crybaby crap right now...

432
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,775
...and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,237
Something--
Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,407
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,327
You made poison out of beans, yo.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
436
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,747
All right, look. We got--

437
00235:.23,955 => 00:35:29,085
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,338
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

439
00:35:31,546 =-> 00:35:34,132
..-.and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,260
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

441
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,764
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

442
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,683
...or a homing device...

443
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,727
...or build a new battery or....

444
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,771
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,231
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

446
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,902
..-and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,988
You know, like a....
Like a dune buggy.

00:

00

00

448
35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,700
And that way,
can just dune-buggy or....

449
36:01,534 ==> 0023.62 05,872
What? Hey. What is it?

450

:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,416

What?

451

236:09,292 --> 00:36:12,170

Do you have any money?

 

452
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,505
Change, I mean. Coins.
453
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,508
-Yeah, got a bunch from the--
-Okay.
454
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,551
-Yes.
-Gather them.
455
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22, 639

And washers and nuts and bolts

and screws...

456

00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,267

...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457

00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,063

It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458

00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,440

-Solid zinc, okay.
-And-- And bring me--

459

00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,026

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

Bring me brake pads.
460
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,822
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,783
-Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

462
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,414
What are we building?

463
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,126
-You said it yourself.
-A robot?

464
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,461
-A battery.
SY6S'.

465
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,588
Move!

466
00237:06,933 => 00:37: 10,979
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

4607
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,356
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,360
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,448
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00237 $21,656 == 00237: 23,324
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:25,869
Well, think about it.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
472
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,748
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,709
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

474
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,044
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,839
-Right.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,676
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

477
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,095
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

478
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,475
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,979
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00237:53,646 =-> 00°87:55, 774
Then.... Here, I'll show you.
481

00:37:55,982 =-—> 00:37:58,526
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00, 612
This.

483
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,531
Tte"s zine.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
484
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,828
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,457
-So the sponge is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

486
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,544
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00238316, 753 =—> 00738% 20,882
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,343
Good.

489
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:29,098
Good. And now, what shall we use...

490
00238:29,307 =—> 00:38:32,018
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:37,565
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,240
Wire.

493
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,868
Copper.

494
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,120
-Oh, I mean--
-Copper.

495
O00238:51,329 =--> 00:38:52,789
Right.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
496
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,877
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,964
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,092
We've only got material enough
for six.

499
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,182
Okay.

500
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,188
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
002393 17,397 == 007395 18,898
All right.

502
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,861
Cathode.

503
00239327,9049 == 00739% 29,534
Anode.

504
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,745
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,291
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00239:56,227 =--> 00:39:57,270

How's everyone doing?

00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,948
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,203
-I know. I know, enough already. It's--
-I'm teasing.

523
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,414
Everything in its time.

524
002422.23,291. <-> 00242225,:835
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,798
-Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,971
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,891
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,477
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,729
To classify someone
as in remission...

530
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47, 648
...we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

634.
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,234
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51, 986
Technically speaking...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
533
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,239
...a tumor can remain
the exact same size it was before...

534
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,909
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01, 662
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage III adenocarcinoma...

536
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,873
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

537
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,710
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumor mass...

538
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:13,424
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15, 468
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,598
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:24,185
Walt, your tumor has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542

00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,026

-Oh, my God.

-Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
543

00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,403

Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.

544

00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,031

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,286
-Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,623
-Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
-Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,584
-It's very good news.
-It's very good news.

548
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51, 838
-Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,300
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,727
That's great.

551
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,566
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15, 653
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,990
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,576
See that scary-looking thing there?

 

555
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25, 621
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
556
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,083
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,377
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,505
Tissue inflammation? I....

55.9.
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,674
Are you sure about that? I mean, I--

560
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:42,680
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,850
-What?
-You probably have a tear...

562
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,685
-in your esophagus from coughing.

563
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,730
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,317
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,361
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,114
-I'm sorry, I just--
-No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:04,076
With something like this,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,456
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,583
But now at least
we have some options...

570
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,628
...the most important of which
is time.

571
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,131
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,135
But for now, I'd say that you folks

00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,900
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,737
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,990
-What?
-Just take the rest of the week.

4
00202: 37,157 ==> 0002239, 910
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,828
Don't push it.

6
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,165
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,920
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,799
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56, 343
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,429
Just family and a few friends.

141.
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,891
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07, 437
Sounds good.

13
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,826
Oh, thank you.

14
00#032.20,992 => 00:03: 22,\661
Now..

15
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,747
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00203225,914 ==> 003033 29,292
-Nothing.
-Excellent.

17
002.03: 33,.255 => 00:08: 35, 757
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00205309, 768 ==-> 00:05:11,394
Can you meet?

19
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18, 693
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,362
..-kicked.

21
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,906
Signed-- Signed off.

22
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,700
I was even checking the obits.

23
00#052.26,243 => 00205227, 911
No such luck.

24
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,957
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,419
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,506
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,424
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,760
The upshot.

29
00:05:46,513 =-> 00205: 51,101
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00205: 54,271. => 00:05: 55,272
Damn.

31
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,860
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,448
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,285
In Bact. ww
34

00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,454
...the news is all good.

35
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,207
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,836
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,131
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

38
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:27,888
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,308
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumors.

40
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,060
How significant?

41
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,438
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,815
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,110
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,324
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,493
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,412
That's-- That's great, man.

47
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,167
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,586
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,254
Yeah.

50
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,965
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,968
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,013
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay, now we....

54
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,021
I mean, what do we...?
55

00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,191
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,532
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,786
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,664
-in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,046
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

60
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,256
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,092
And then....
62

00207:50,512 =-> 00:07: 53,890
Well, then I guess...

63

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00207 255,225 ==> 00207: 56,726
...I'm done.

64
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,916
-Batter up.
-Everyone?

65
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,378
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00208:.23,962 => 00:08:28,550
-...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,595
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:38,018
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,520
But then again...

70
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,275
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

EL
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,655
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,284
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,622
..wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,292
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,628

77

Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. am.

78
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,306
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,976
And for the first time
in a long time...

 

80
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,146
..we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,653
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,825
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
002.09;35,992 =-> 00:09:38,995
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85

You want me to go back to bed?

76
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,455
No, guess that'd be kind of--

77
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,000
No.

78
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,129

No, I got it.

Is there any coffee?

82

Yeah, shit. One second.

Well, at least let me do that.

-That would be me.

If I leave them at home, I'll just

wind up eating them all myself, so....

2k.
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,726
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,853
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213

227

23.1,

It's not an issue.

232
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,641
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:53,479
-No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

 

 

234
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,244
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,497
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,583

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,338
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,049
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,848
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240

That's Kanga-man.

241
00222:32,226 =-> 00:22:34,854
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:35,437 => 00°227539,357
-And who's this in his pouch?
-His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,153
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,947
wwitibghbs, erime.

245
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,117
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,744
You know that, right?

247
00322:51,036 --> 00:22:53,539
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00222:55,373 => 00°22:57,877
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,378
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,549
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,139
-And this is?
-It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,059
Wait, no. I actually--
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,353
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,230
He can make everything
go in reverse.

256
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,482
Time and stuff? Like time traveling?

257
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,235
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,238
He walks backwards?

259
00223326,572 ==" 00323229, 617
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
002232259, 783 =<“ 00%2.3932,:202
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00223: 32,369 --> 00°23; 35,331
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,834
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,711
Okay.

264
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,421
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,174
...when I drew all these.

266
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,927
It was like four years ago.

267
00223:48,761 => 00:23:51,889
-They all look like you.
-What?

268
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,934
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:55,643 =-> 00:23:57,269
No.

270
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,481
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,858
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,110

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,298
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,385

332
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,892
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333:
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,771
I should have used
better judgment all around.

334
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,983
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

335
002283 55,150 == 002285 5%y),361
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,821
But I kept up, right?

337
002293 01,865 ==> 0022 9% 05,911
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,504
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,067
Hey.

Yo.

What?

345
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,212
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,965
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:47,220
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,681
If anything, I was doing you a favor.

A favor?

-He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

352
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,859
-So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

353
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,404
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,157
-How's that?

I bought a filter.

357
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,291
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,544
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,213
So?

-2F don't.

Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,733

at the end of the tunnel.

But lately, it just feels like....

Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

I got a bad feeling, man.

I need some backup.

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,855
-What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,067
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,636
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,056
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,516
Absolutely.

17
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,101
As you know...

18
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,312
.-my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,275
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:57,988
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00203258,155 ==> 003033 59,990
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,868
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23.
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,662
..-performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,206
He's got a good track record.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
25
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,000
Pretty good.

26
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,753
It sounds... «

27
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,172
..-aggressive.

28
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,507
Yes. Very much so.

 

29
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,510
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

 

30
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,013
..-you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,348
And it will.

32
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,227
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,522
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,192
...but that's all.

35
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,194
In my opinion...

36
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,032

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,626
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,629
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,256
...and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,052
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,055
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,727
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,231
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,650
No.

46
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,110
I'll do it.

47
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:29,079
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,375
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,757
I have to say,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,052
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

51
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,054
..for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,557
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,018
That's tricky.

54
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,275
-When's the due date?
-It's the 21st.

55
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59, 818
So two weeks and change?

56
00205:59,985 =-> 00:06:02,237
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,574
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,119
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,808
Fourteen messages....

61

00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,440
~Yeah.
-It's me.

63
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,068
Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.

64
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43, 653
Working.

65

What is it?

66
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,951
Combo's dead.

67
00206:50,535 ==> 00:06:52,162
Shot.

68
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,998
Which one is he?

69
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,834
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,503
-Jesse, listen--
-That figures.

71
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,809
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17, 646
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,024
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00207:321,191 =-> 00:07:25,028

...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,533
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,535
...-what'd you expect?

77
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,080
I don't know.

78
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,957
You don't know?

79
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,001
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,047
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,512
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00207:52,722 --> 00:07:55,392
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83

and Badger laying low out in Cali....

84

That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104

-How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

Now, the police,

One of our dealers was murdered.

1
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,337
It was some kind of turf dispute...

2
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,672
...and apparently we lost.

3
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,591
And then everyone quit on us.

 

4
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,678
I mean,

we have absolutely no distribution.

5

00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,348
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

It's better. Do you mind?

Better?
21

00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,908

You're on the low side of normal.

What? How low?

227
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,432
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

Okay, we've been talking

~The C-section?

And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:03,893
Well, my last labor
was pretty tough, so....

244
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,021
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,982
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,487
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

00227:13,215 --> 00:°27:15,509
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,472
And five minutes of your time.

340
00227 430,983 ==> 00327: 33,735
-What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

341
00227:35,571. <> 00327: 37,072
Please.

342
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,796
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,884
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,638
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,850
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,604
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,356
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,196
Sir, if you have a complaint...

349
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,781
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,451
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,914
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

352
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,416
..is very careful.

353
00228:29,583 --> 00:28:31,627
A cautious man.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
354
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,339
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,094
If you are who I think you are...

356
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,722
..-you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,647
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,276
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,488
Your partner was late
and he was high.

360
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,408
Yes. Yes, he was.

3161
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,412
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,793
You have poor judgment.

363
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,255
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

364
00229:16,421 =-> 00:29:19,591
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,804
-I've been told it's excellent.
-It is impeccable.

366

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00229%25,013 ==> 00229: 26,473
It is the purest...

367
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,143
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,688
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,858
You could charge twice
the current rate for what I provide...

370
00329: 37,025 =-->. 00329: 39,528
...and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,822
Hands down.

372
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:48,996
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,206
You won't see him.

374
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,167
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,378
Forget he exists.

376
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,215
I have to ask.

377
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,051
Why?

378
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,053
Why him?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
379
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,267
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,146
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,899
How much product
do you have on hand?

382
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,569
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,405
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00#302.29,619 => 00:30: 31,496
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,542
I have your numbers.

386
002302 39,713 => 00:30: 43, 717
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,443
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

388
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,821
...-but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,575
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,327
Dribs and drabs.

391.
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,621

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

392
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,291
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,588
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,261
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,473
I found six other instances...

396
O0831432,599 s-> 00931485,185
...of revenues being under-reported.

3.97
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,897
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,484
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

3.9.9
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,945
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,030
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401

00731247,197 =-> 00:31:49, 658

I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

 

 

402
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,993
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
403
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,829
Obviously, we forgot...

404
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:58,041
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,503
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

406
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,340
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,801
Right.

408
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,594
Right...

409
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,433
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

410
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,018
...to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,190
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,694
In a few cases...

413
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,365
...1 found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,120
Ted.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
415
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,923
All right.

416
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,302
You got me.

417
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,724
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00832: 56,141. > 00322 59,311
-What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

419
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01, 688
..-about saving a company.

420
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

421
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,692
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

422
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,196
..-.and their college funds
for their kids.

423
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,239
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,034
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

a25
00233214,201 +-> 00:33:15, 911
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,038
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
427
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,541
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,210
-If I don't keep up--
-Ted.

429
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,254
People go to prison for this.

430
002334 32,219 s=> 002333 35,347
My dad built this company
from nothing.

431
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,683
We make things here.

432
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,937
The people who work here
are like family.

433
00233:42,437 <-> 00:33:46,233
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,905
Sky...

435
00233254,658 ==> 00:33:56,701
...don't report this.

436
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,287
Please.

437
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,167
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,466
But I can't be a part of it.

439

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,012
I know.

440
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,890
I know. I just wish....

441
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,689
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,501
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

444
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,462
Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.

445
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,506
We missed you at the funeral today.

446
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,174
The whole crew was representing.

447
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,343
Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.

448
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,637
Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...

449
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,806
...everyone was all choked up
and shit.

450
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,684
Man, it was, like, emotional.

451
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,853
And you should have

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
seen the coffin.

452
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,938
It was this shiny white pearlescent.

453
00:35:07,105 =-> 00:35:10,233
I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.

454
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,403
So we're definitely talking high-end.

455
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16, 823
Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.

456
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,118
Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.

457
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,579
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,796
Hold that.

459
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,633
What's it feel like?

460
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,097
There's a chill.

461
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,559
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,310
And then....

463
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,645
You'll see.

464

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00237315,358 ==> 00737: 17,068
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,457
Take that off.

466
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,024
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,169
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,172
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,841
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,274
Yess

471
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,165
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01, 668
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473

00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,296
No, no, no.

I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,383
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

 

475
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,134
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,178
Oh, owner. Okay.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

477
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,181
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,642
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:22,397
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480

00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,316

I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481

00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,611

Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy

to refer you to our website.
482

00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,655

No, no.

483

00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,824

-What's his name?
-Gustavo.

484

00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,534
Gus.
485

00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,743

Thank you.

486

00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,500

Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487

00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,170

 

 

Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,714
-One hour.
-What?
489
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,094
In. In. Absolutely.

But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,304
One hour. If you miss it...

492
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,224
...don't ever show your face

in here again.

I'm coming by. I need the product.

I need the product now.

Congratulations, Walt.

Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19

I mean, this little bundle of joy of ours
was practically on rails.

20
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,351
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

21
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,394
...and deliver her himself.

22
00202:25,937 --> 00:02:30,567
Well, that--

I'm glad it didn't come to that.

Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24

Listen, take it easy, Sky.

C-section. You know?

But I'm just so glad,

-My birthday.
-Your re-birthday?

00:

71
O0e07211,556 --> 00:07213, 600
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,644
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,270
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,814
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
OO707:19,981 =--> 00:07221, 983

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
76
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,195
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
008071425,362 s=>' 002073 26,571
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,657
All it would take is one friend...

719
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,534
..-.and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

80
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,870
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,040
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,731
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,026
-You getting enough sleep?
-Actually, no.

84
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,408
-Yeah?
-A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,202
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,872

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,083
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,253
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,674
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,343
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,429
You need to avoid
those type of people.

93
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,598
I know and I do.

94
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,061
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,105
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,191
Thank you.

97
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,032

What about that guy next door?
05
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,599

What do you mean?

 

06
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,143
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

 

07
00209:20,310 --> 00:09:21, 936
..of you introducing me to him.

08
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,230

-Do I have to spell it out for you?
-I know. I know.

00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,529
You're thinking that I should be
funneling money...

...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

I am not going to have
my family think that some...

324

Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

325
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,792
That would raise too many questions.
However--

This guy can hijack
random desktops...

344

I mean, first off, I taught him.

345
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,946
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

-I don't understand why you need him.
-Exactly.

349
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,642
My point exactly.

350

Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

351

How much does he owe you,
anyway?

"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

Because what I know about you,

Shit.

He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

486
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,150
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

487
00233206,651 ==> 00333: 11,114
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

488
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,492
We won't have to. He'll pay.

489
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,077
And what if he doesn't?

490
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,163
Jesse, it's your money.

491
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,834
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

What is it, really?

493

You don't want
your half a million dollars?

494

You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

495

I'm your partner.

The largest land animal

She is finally asleep.

What you doing,
learning about elephants?

 

505

Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

How do I know she'll keep quiet?

you don't.

00:36:44,035
I guess

You'll never hear
from either of us again.

Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

525

And I can be a bush pilot.

Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

as long as it's the two of us.

But first, we gotta get clean.

anybody is telling us to.

Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

546
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,732
What if we went up a size
and just kind of....

547

All right, all right. No, I understand.

Oh, well, actually...

559
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,948
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

560

-and process that into providing
fuel for man's space flights.

561

Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

Old enough to know better.

when I was his age.

Kids today grow up faster, I think.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

This nephew who is--

I mean, he's an adult.

 

 

590
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:01,644
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

591
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,732
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

592
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07, 442
You know, that....

593
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,029

594
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,283

"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you,

so listen."

595

But of course, they don't.

601
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,147

Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,330
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,376
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,712
Here's your story.
27
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,217
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,302
Say it.

29
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,891
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,897
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02, 983
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,526
Again.

33
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07, 362
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,155
Again. Again.

35
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,325
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,912
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,211
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,006
..will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,591
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,094
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,388
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,099
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,560
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,104
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,735
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,070
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,489
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,118
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,039
I was not here.

50

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,092

You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,219
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,560
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

53
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,117
Hang tough.

You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,354
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,192
-Two.
-Two. All right.

56
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,571

Flynn, get your butt in here.

65

Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66

76
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,955
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."

"Hang in there."

Isn't this awesome?

That's-- Wow, that is something.

719
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,261
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,557
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,977
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

Damn.
Five hundred and ten dollars.

84

If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,386
I can drive.

105
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,554
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

Will you both be coming?

They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

Biggest donation...

Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,795
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48, 966
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,802
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,555
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,350
...-from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137

This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

38

So why am I talking about him?

Anyone? Anyone?

40

-That's right.

Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:34, 637
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

They think they got their man.

James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

I got a bridge to sell you.

a pack of cigarettes...

Are they here now?

188

00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,467
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

89
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,762
Police could be the least of it.

90
002193 39,9029 == 002195 41,931
You could just get mugged or shot.

91
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,311
How about you go on home, Walter?

92
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,522
Let me handle this.

I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

There's no yellow dress here.

It's all-- It's all black and gray.

 

225

When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226

What about blue?

227
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,181
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,018
No, no. Not dark blue. More like....

Nope. Not a one.

Thank you very much.

I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,238
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,532
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

282
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,036
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

283
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,039
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,043
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

285
00%27:50,210 ==> 00:27:53,213
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,799
-Terrible.
-Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,551
We've had
some successes locally...

288
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,887
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

weapons we have.

291

Anything we can do.

Is this one of your agents?

296

Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297

He's got a health issue.
We're trying to--

Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299

-Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

He's keeping it for you.

Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,152
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay?

309
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,197
I deserve this.

00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,508
Walt, they're doing a feature

317
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,053
We called you about 50 times.

318

Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,310
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...

320
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:57,064
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,733
-This is him?
-Yes.

322
00230759,900 ==> 003313 01,276
This is Dad. Great.

Mom and Dad?

326

How much money
have you raised so far?

327
00#31213,872 => 00:312 17,584
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,878
But there's more coming in
all the time.

329

-We don't even know what to say.

330

It's just-- It's been incredible.

331
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,012
Judging from things you have
written about him...

332
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:34,935
-...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,604
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

334
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,942
None of us do. We love him.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,034
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337

He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338

He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

He's just decent.

340
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,675
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,303
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00#32:10,470 => 00:32:15,308
-Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,238
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,866
This one just relaxes him a little.

00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,006
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

350
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,111
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,447
As a matter of fact....

352
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:19,206
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
O0333 21,166 == 002335 22, 667
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,589
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00233328,507 == 00733: 31,218
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,054
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,014
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,560
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,105
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,525
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,401
Which one?

362
00:33:51,905 =-> 00:33:57,160
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,122
Okay.

364
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,034
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,578
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,748
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but....

367
00#352.24,914 => 0033.5: 27,L6/
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,376
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

369
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:33,089

Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

370
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,133
...here somewhere.

371
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,595
-She's beautiful.
-Thanks.

372
002352: 39,137 => 00:35: 41,890
Always a relief to say that

and actually mean it.

373
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,895
-How's your pain level, Walter?
LIES os seas

374
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,064
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,191
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,152
-A bit, but much better.
-Good.

377
00235:55,236 => 00:35:57,072
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:35:57,238 -->. 00°:35% 58,782
I can't foresee the future...

379
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,742
...but even
conservatively speaking...

380
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,578
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,207
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,209
That's great.

383
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,004
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00#36:14,339 => 00:36:17,759
So when could he get back

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

to his normal routine?

385
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,345
-He can ease into it now.
-Okay.

386
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:25,934
-And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,355
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,149
But he can be on his own?

389
00236: 33,316 => 00:36: 36,611
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

390
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,614
Yes. Use your best judgment.

391.
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,741
Well....

392
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,536
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393)
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,038
One less baby in the house.

394
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,593
-Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,263
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,432

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:12,021
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14, 983
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,402
Terrible thing. Just....

400
00237:218,111 s=> 002373 21,322
But you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and....

401
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,200
-You been doing okay?
-I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,121
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

403
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,875
-so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,337
-Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

405
002374 36,963 ==> 00737: 38,339
Yeah.

406
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,342
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,347
Continue to descend through 1500.

Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:30:11,289 --> 00:38:13,917
I think I may just keep this.

415

Sky?

416
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,379
What do you think?

417
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,258
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,720
What are you doing?

 

419
00:38:25,887 =-> 00:38:28,515
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,602
-Since when?
-I'm taking the baby with me.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
421
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,729
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,149
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,528
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

424
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,738
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,075
Hank has offered to help. You
shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,577
-Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,412
I want--

428
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,039
I want you gone.

429
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,761
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,098
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
002393 12,225 == 0073.95 13,935
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,396
What?

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
433
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,566
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

434
002392 15,732 => 00:39: 23,i61L1
...and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,114
When?

436
002392.26,281. “> 00:39: 28, 86/
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,244
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,453
You know what I think?

439
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,542
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

440
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,628
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,797
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,925
Then it got me thinking again...

443
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,721
..-about all the strange behavior.

444
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,390
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00239:52,557 --> 00:39:55,059

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

446
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,186
...checking the morgue.

447
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,148
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,320
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,989
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,162
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

451
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,164
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,500
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,837
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,298
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,176
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,762
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,308

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,020
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,022
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

460
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,317
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,365
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,533
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,911
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,706
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,584
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,380
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,217
The money for your treatment...

468
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,472
..-Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
469
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,892
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,520
You refused every offer
they made you.

471
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,021
But that didn't make sense...

472
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,732
-because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

473
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,194
-and not including your surgery...

474
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,405
..we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,449
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:39,038
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,507
But then...

478
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,177
..-I called your mother.

479
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,764
Yeah.

480
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59, 684
Thanks for that too.

 

 

481
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02, 687
But I thought, you know,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
maybe she has some money...

482
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,983
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,236
It's possible.

484
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,868
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

485
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:22,123
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00242:.25,293 => 00342227, 670
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,424
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,051
You were gone for four days...

489
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,055
...and yet she swears...

490
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,891
...that you were never there.

491
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48, 983
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,903
Skyler.

493
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,781
Could you...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

494
00:42:55,656 --> 00742:57,533
...just once...

495
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:04,290
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

496
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,051
Skyler.

497
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,346
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,848
I....

499
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,684
Skyler, please, don't go.

500
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:37,365

If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,453

Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,623
Whatever it is...

503
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,709
