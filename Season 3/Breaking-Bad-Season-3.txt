00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,882
We interrupt scheduled programming
to bring you this breaking news.

2
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,217
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes...

3
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,470
..-KOB has received
dozens of reports...

4
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,140
...of what appears to be a crashed
aircraft, possibly two aircraft...

5
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,142
...on Albuquerque's east side.

6
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,935
As of yet details are scarce...

7
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,147
...but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead...

8
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,399
..-followed by falling debris.
Visible now--

9
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37, 944
--crash investigators with the

National Transportation Safety Board...

10
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40, 947
...are expected on site
as early as this evening.

11
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,115
But officials warn...

12
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,368

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...that with a debris field
of this magnitude, the investigation--

13
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,954
Officials are now saying
that the Boeing 737...

14
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,458
..was being re-routed,
or vectored, through the airspace...

15
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,920
..which is standard procedure
according to a spokesman for the FAA.

16
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,423
The eight-seat King Air 350
was a charter flight...

17
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,844
...operating out of St. George, Utah,
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

18
00205: 03,011 => 00:05:06,097
It sounded like hail,
like heavy hailstones.

19
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:11,186
It was just bump-bump-bump,
all over the neighborhood....

20
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:16,066
--indicating that the final death toll
now stands at 167.

 

21
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,028
--one hundred and sixty-seven.

22
002052207195 --> 00:05:22,531
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering...

23
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,658

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
..-how such an accident
could take place...

24
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,493
..in a system
with so many safeguards.

25
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,162
--that the collision
which brought down Flight 515...

26
00#052.29,329 => 00:05: 32, 791
...was caused
by improper air traffic control.

27
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,836
We have the bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City...

28
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,212
...as the FAA confirmed...

29
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,340
..it was indeed a lone

air traffic controller's fateful mistake...

30
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,134
...-which brought about the crash.

3
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,013
--is Donald Margolis,
a 19-year veteran...

32
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,309
...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Albuquerque....

33
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,188
--Margolis recently returned to work
after a five-week absence...

34
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57, 649
..which was due to, quote,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
"a personal loss."

35
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,736
While it's now known that Margolis
had recently lost a daughter to a--

36
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,405
--drug overdose a month before.

37
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,408
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26...

38
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,578
..-apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.

39
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
Friends of the family say...

40
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,249
...the death of his only child
hit Margolis particularly hard.

41
00206315, 750 ==> 00706: 18,253
Coming as it did
little more than a month before...

42
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,256
..many are questioning
the timing of his return to work...

43
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,758
...and are wondering
how much blame truly lies...

44
00206:23,925 ==> 00:06:26,219.
...with those
who let this grieving father--

45
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,876
I usually open with
"So sorry you're here."

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
46
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,170
Where would you like to begin?

47
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,382
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

48
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:32,387
As quick as something like this
@am be... SO:

49
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:38,059
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

50
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,478
Does he know?

51
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,399
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so....

52
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,067
Has he moved out?

53
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,361
We're in the process
of moving him out.

54
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,738
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

55
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,908
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

56
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,827
...and I are staying with my sister.

57
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,706
-So you've moved out?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Well, yes, just temporarily.

58
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,167
Only so he could
get his things and....

59
002093 02,333 ==> 007093 06,254
That was supposed to happen last
week, but then came the crash and....

60
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,339
Oh, God, you weren't one of the--?

61
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,426
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

62
OO#092 11,593 => 00:09: 17,932
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighborhood, so....

63
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,935
-Terrible.
-Yeah. Apparently, even...

64
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,105
-you know, parts of bodies.

65
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,943
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to....

66
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
-So awful.
-I know.

67
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,616
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

68
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:39,704
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

69
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,458
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

70
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,378
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

71
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,797
Two children, you said?

72
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:55,762
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

73
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,101
-They need to stay with me.
-Okay.

74
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,312
-How long have you been married?
-Sixteen years.

715
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,232
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

76
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10, 652
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage...?

77
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:15,782
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

78
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,827
What about other debts or assets?

79
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,079
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
80
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,581
...of you and your husband's
financial situation?

81
O0#10227,502 => 00s102 29,92.
-Is your husband employed?
-Here's the thing.

82
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:34,342
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

83
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,847
-...or I don't know, just--
-No, no loopholes.

84
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,351
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

85
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47, 689
...of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

86

00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51, 860

To that end,

I say let's leave no stone unturned.

87
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,116
You'd be amazed what I've seen

partners hide from one another.

 

88
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,356
Walt?

89
OO#LL: 31,232 —“> 00s.11232,358
Hey, buddy?

90
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,164
Hey, Walt?

91
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,541

-Hey.
-There you are.

92
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,586
Listen, I.... You know, well....
93
00211 352,253 == 002113 54,088
Tt"'S sees
94
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,090
It's time.
95
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,515

 

 

The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.

96
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,601
This’ dis: Lt.
Hands down, we're living it.

97
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,019
I speak with authority...

98
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,897
...because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

99
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,273
But this here? I mean...

100
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,610
...-call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking....

101
00%12:15,777 ==> 00:12:18,112
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

102
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,283
But this situation between you and....
You know, I don't know.

103

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,953
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

04
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,247
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

05
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,249
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

06
00212:29,415 --> 00:12:31,793

You beat a little tactical retreat...

07
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,380
..you regroup, and then:

 

08

00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:40,759
You know, absence makes the....
Yeah.

109
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,976
I'm pulling for you, man.

I'm pulling for you.

00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,609

-No heavy lifting. I got it.
-No, it's okay.

 

 

A,
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,653
I got. it.
2

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,740
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

I3
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,413
Half a million in cash.

114
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,962
That's the spirit.

15:

Who's here for self-improvement?

Come on, give me a show of hands.

You certainly

it's actually very nice, very pleasant.

Not as high-end as the Oakwood,

I don't know what's going on.

I don't even care anymore.

138
00215: 09,325 —-> 00215211, 744
Can you just give me

39

00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:17,166
-I'll take you to school.
-Yeah. No, 'm ready now.

40
002153175333 ==> 00215: 20,503
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

41
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,842
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

42
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,872
Okay.

43
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,758
May I have your attention, please?

 

44
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,678
As all of you know, last week
our city suffered a terrible tragedy.

 

145
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,680
One that none of us will ever forget.

146
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,518
Which is why today we're going to

 

take a little time out of our schedule...

147
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,354
...to gather in the gym and talk.

148
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:09,028
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

149
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,867
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

150
00217:15,660 --> 00:17:18,913
It just really

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
gets inside your brain and....

151
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,168
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

152
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,047
...like, if you come home and find him

153
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,176
...it's basically an automatic A
for you.

154
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,888
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is....

00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,724
-Is something to--
-Okay. Thank you, Barry.

56
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,518
Who wants to go next?

57
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,148
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

 

58
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:51,946
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

59

There you go, honey.

I just keep asking myself....

61
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,584
Honey, could you please stand up?

 

62
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,378

Thank you.

163
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:11,048
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

164
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,552
I mean, if there's a God and all...

165
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,264
..why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

166
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,767
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

167
OO#18221,934 => 00s182 25, 563
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

68
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,024
Does anyone else have that?

69
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,071
I just keep hearing that sound.

 

70
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,117
That boom.
71

 

 

00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,372
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

172
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,629
Thank you, sweetheart.

118
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,758

-Over here.

My neighbor, he heard the crash...

175
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,812
...and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

176
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,106
Like an airline seat.

177
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
Like what you have on a airliner?

178
002193 lig ITSO == 001 9% 15,824.
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

179
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,660
..vight next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

80
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,289
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

81
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,750
Human legs.

82
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,420
Jesus H. Christ.

 

83
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,468
-You okay?
“Yeah, sorry: I'ms. a.

184
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,805
I was just moved.

185
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,933

from the faculty.

Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

187
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,441
Mr. White,

would you like to say something?

88
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,612
And by the way, welcome back.

89
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,457
It's so good to have you back.

90
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:29,145
I guess what I would-- Sorry, sorry.

91
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,526
I guess what I would wanna say is...

92

00:20:36, 652
...to look on

--> 00:20:40,531
the bright side.

93
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,412
First of all,

nobody on the ground was killed.

94
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,038
And that....
95

00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,710
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban center?

 

96
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:58,674
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So....

197
--> 00:21:02,094
neither plane was full.

00:20:58,841
Plus,

198
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:08,768
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

199
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,353
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

200
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,066
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

201
O0021:16,233 --> 00:21920,279
..-is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

202
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,449
Actually, tied for 50th.

203
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,452
There are, in truth...

204
OO821427,077 ==> OORQIE31, 957
-53 crashes throughout history...

205
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,420

..that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

206
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,591
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

 

 

207
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45, 930
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...

208
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48, 641
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.

209
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,812
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

210
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,233
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
211
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,737
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

212
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:07,493
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

213
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:13,833
You know why?
It's because people move on.

2
00:22:14, 834
They just

2

4

--> 00:22:16,168

move on.

5

00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,922

And we will too.
and we will g

We will move on,
et past this.

00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:26,846
Because that is what
human beings do, we survive, and....
217
--> 00:22:32,601
we overcome. Yeah.

00222327, 721
We survive and

218
--> 00:22:36,981
We survive and--

00:22:33,310
We survive.

-Thank you.

No, I....

226
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,823
He's gone.

227
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,954
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

228
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,166
-How's what?
-Tricks. It's an expression.

229
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,085
How are you?

230
00226:26,251 =-> 00:26:29,463
Why you gotta treat him like this?

231
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,131
Why you gotta be like this?

232
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,844
-Why can't you just talk even?
-Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

233
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,567
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

234
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,491
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

235

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00226:57,658 ==> 00227: 03,330
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

236
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,836
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

237
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,630
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

238
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,509
-Marie. Marie.
-...that my mother would leave--?"

239
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,469
I can't help you get through this...

240
00227 § 179635, == 008275 20,722
..-you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did.

241
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,393
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

242
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,063
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

243
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,190
-That would be really great...
-"Pryings"

244
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,403
-...and so helpful.
-Well, prying's a strong word.

245
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:45,164

You know what I'm talking about.

248
00227 $54,131, ==> 00227: 56,925
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

249
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,096
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

250
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,515
-president of the United States?

25.1,
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,019
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

252
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,896
But now...

253
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,901
»..are you good enough to deserve
your share of basic human happiness?

254
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:19,072
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

255
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,450
I say yes.

256
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,789
But it doesn't matter what I say.

257
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,126

I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

Just come on. Let us in on it.

So, like, what makes you the expert?

I don't think I ever said I was that.

Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

265

Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

266
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,421
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

267
00:29:17,297 --> 00729: 21,802
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

268
00#292.21,969 => 0022992 7,:849
...-but did you ever really
hurt someone?

269
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,355
I killed my daughter.

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,824
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

271
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,370
July 18th, 1992.

272
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,207
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

273
00229:52,374 =-> 00:29:56,670
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

274
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58, 338
I had plenty left.

2715
00%29758,505 ==> 00230% 01,1338
But I was out of vodka.

276
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,218
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

277
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06, 680
..- where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

278
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08, 640
...they have these ABC stores...

279
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:14,771
..-which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

280
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,859
So I'm arguing with my wife.

281
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,863
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."

283
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,996
And she's saying "No, no."

284
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,044
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

285
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,715
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

286
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,053
She's playing
at the end of the driveway.

287

288
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,523
How do you not hate yourself?

289
00230759,358 =—> 007313 02,778
I did hate myself for a long time.

290
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,908
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

291
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,786
It just made it that much worse.

292
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,459
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

293
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,295
It just stands in the way.

294

Why are you even thinking this way?

-Is it to punish me?
-I am not punishing you, Walt.

--> 00:34:02,916
drug dealer.

313
--> 00:34:11,132

No. What--? How...? What?

00:34:20, 600

00:34:24,145

314
--> 00:34:22,435

Yeah.

315
--> 00:34:27,816

How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

00:34:31,611

316
--> 00:34:36,783

Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

00:34:44,499

00:34:48,503
Oh, my

317
--> 00:34:46,001
No?

 

318
--> 00:34:51,172
God, Walt.

any of it at all.
319
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,093
Cocaine?

320
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,932
It's methamphetamine.

321
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:08,273
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

B22
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,694
...per se.
323
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,489
It doesn't mean.... No, Skyler!
324

00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,200
-Listen to me. Skyler, listen--
-No, no!

325
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,829
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

 

326
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:28,001
So please, let's-- Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

B27
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,962
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

328
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,884
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

329
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,969
Nobody will hear it from me.

330
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,890
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

331
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44, 643
-No, Skyler--
-I mean it.

332
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,355
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

333
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,872
Bye, Jesse.

334
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,725
Your windshield's broken.

335
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,896
Yeah.

336
00:36:36,111 =-> 00:36:39,614
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

337
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,784
Strictly temporary. We're just....

338
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,203
We're just taking a little break.

 

339
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,958
That's you, over there.

340
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,796
Listen, money.

341
00236:55,255 ==> 00:36:58,425
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better--

342
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00, 468
I'm better.

343
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,806

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
You're better? Really?

344
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:11,312
-What, the rehab? It helped?
-Yeah. I'm done using.

345
00237 413,398 ==> 00737: 15,608
That's excellent. That's....

346
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:21,614
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

347
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:28,580
You know,

in spite of how bad things got...

348
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:33,334
..-it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

349
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:38,506
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

350
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,844
...and on the straight and narrow.

351
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,600
You been following
this airplane crash?

352
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,853
Yeah.

353:
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,816
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

354
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,027
...because he was so torn up?

355

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,447
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

356
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,158
You are not responsible for this.

357
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,495
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

358
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:13,041
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

359
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,170
...and there are many factors
at play there.

360
002383 17,337 == 00238s 18,797
Yeah?

361
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:24,177
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

 

362
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,054
-that may not have been working.

363
00#38:26,262 => 00:38: 28,389
That's public record.
You can look that up.

364
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,227
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

365
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,686
No.

366
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,900
No, really, I blame the government.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
367
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:45,573
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

368
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,661
-What exactly does that mean?
-I learned it in rehab.

369
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,415
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

370
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,544
I accept who I am.

371
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,003
And who are you?

372
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,841
I'm the bad guy.

373
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,819
Here's some napkins for you.

374
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24, 946
Enjoy.

375
00239:3.28,825 =—> 00:39: 32,370
-Is the food to your satisfaction?
-Very much.

376
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,081
It's good to see you again.

377
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,336
-May I?
-Please.

378
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,470
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
379
002392 51,6389 --> 00439: 56,352
I actually am not here to....

380
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:04,652
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

381
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,405
...to tell you this personally.

382
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,284
I'm done.
383

00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,372
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

384
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,667
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

385
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,170
...and I appreciate
the way you do business.

386
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,842
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

387
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:33,640
And I'm....
I'm at something of a crossroads...

388
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:39,520
...and it's brought me
to a realization.

389
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,400
I am not a criminal.

390
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,322
No offense to any people who are...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
391
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,204
...but this is not me.

392
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,501
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

393
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,713
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

394
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:10,176
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

395
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,307
Three months, then out.

396
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,190
Three million?

397
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,570
May I take this as a "yes"?

398
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:43,001
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

 

 

399
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,755
What I don't have is my family.

400
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,051
The answer is still no.

401
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,101
Enjoy your meal.

402
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,692
Thank you.

403
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,018

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
That's it!

404
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,062
Did you feel it?

405
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,731
Texas!

406
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,150
I've made this trip three times...

407
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,278
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

408
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,072
...and that's how you know!

409
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,657
We are officially in Texas!

410
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,000
This time I got a job waiting for me.

411
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,296
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

412
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,923
Yo, that's for me, homes!

 

413
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,053
They call me "Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

414
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:22,934
I do pearlescent, color-shift,
you name it.

415
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,687
I painted cars for some of...

416

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,190
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacan.

417
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,569
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

418
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,990
Not much good for working, but....

419
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,619
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver....

420
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,986
What the hell's going on in there?

1
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,664
-Good morning, officer.
-Can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,458
Oh, okay.
3

00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,711
Down means off.

4
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,924
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

5
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,218
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

6
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,679
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't--

7
O02 02: Ldy 846 ——> 002 02019,431
No, sir, your windshield.

8
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,727
License and registration, please.

9
00202: 25,145 => 00202926, 772
Right.

10
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,821
This-- This was from Wayfarer 515.

1
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,909
-My house was in the debris field.
-Okay.

12
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43, 622
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
13
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,333
...some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,669
I understand.

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,134
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

16
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,720
Yes, sir.

I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,306
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

18
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,976
-Then what are you doing?
-Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,230
What? What, you don't believe me?

20
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,691
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

ZA.
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14, 986
...this car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

22
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,909
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

23
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,246
-I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
-I can get out of my own car.

24

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,164
-Sir, listen--
-No, you listen to me.

25
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,125
It's time for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,002
-Take a deep breath, calm down.
-This is America, okay?

27
00203:31,169 =-> 00:03:34,005
-Get back in that car.
-I have rights. You understand that?

28
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,967
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

29
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,386
-Step back now.
-Did you even hear what I said?

30
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41, 680
-Sir, calm down.
-You're giving me a ticket?

31
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,182
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

32
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,102
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

33
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,147
-Sir, calm down.
-Hellfire rained down on my house...

34
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51, 648
..where my children sleep!

35
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,901

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-I need you to step back now.
-There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,028
-Are you kidding me?!
-Sir, last warning.

37
00203¢57,195 --> 00703: 59,156
-You got two seconds to stand down.
“Or?

38
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,826
-I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
-Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

39
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,205
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the First Amendment!

40
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,151
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:41,615
Border Patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

42
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,869
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez into Laredo.

43
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,205
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

44
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,165
...with these polleros for two years.

45
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,585
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

46
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,170

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Hit them hard.

47
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,840
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

48
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,343
So this truck was carrying more

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,553
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,556
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

51
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,600
Why'd the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

52
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,727
They didn't. I pulled it.

53
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,773
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,151
Question is, why do we have
Juarez-style action...

55
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,237
...on our side of the DMZ?

56
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,781
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

57
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,785
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?

We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

Don't worry.

80
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,234
So you're selling the place.

81
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,280
In this market. Can you believe it?

It's quite an operation.

We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

85
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,668
...sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

86

Yeah.

88
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,678
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

89
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,974
I read that in, I wanna say,
like TIME magazine.

90
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,728
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

91
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,731
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

92
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:06,152
...granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.

the poor bastard out of his own house.

One word: Blowback.

he probably told her himself.

210
00%19709,3898 =—> 003193 11,567
I-- I don't know.

211
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:16,322
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

212
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,661
It just feels like something more.

213
00%19:29,794 =-> 00:19:33,005
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?

214
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,757
How much is this gonna run me?

215
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,928
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

216
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,555
Yeah, I'll call you.

 

217
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,433
Return of the prodigal,

back to the land of the living.

218
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,143
-How you feeling?

-I'm good.

 

 

219
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,939
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

220
00219: 50,106 <> 0019254, 652
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

221
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:00,282
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

222
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:05,162
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

223
00#20205,329 =<—> 00:20: 09,375
Your former partner. This guy,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
he works like a bastard, right?

224
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,168
Builds a business single-handed.

225
00:20:11,335 =-> 00:20:15,673
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

226
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,011
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

227
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,432
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

228
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,060
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

229
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,521
..but you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

230
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,565
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

231
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,276
All right, all right, scratch that.

232
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,612
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

233
002202 39,321. > 00:20: 41,532
All due respect.

234
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,578
You want a job?

235
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,788

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

A job?

236
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,876
-Who's got a job for me?
-I do.

237
00222 210,496 ==> 00222: 12,331
There you go.

238

00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,460
-Hey.
-Hey.

239
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,046
Thought I'd...

240
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,674
-...well, visit, if you don't mind.
-Of course not.

241
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,635
-You don't need the room, do you?
-No, no, no.

242
00224:29,802 =-> 00224232, 972
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

243
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,974
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

244
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,188
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

245
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43, 691
She's a beauty. Look at her.

246
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:48,070

I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

248
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,290
Listen, believe me, this is--

249
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,086
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

250
00225: 04,253 => 00:25:07,423
I'm sorry, I just can't.

251
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,261
Is that right?

252,
00225: 15,681 => 00:25: 19, 601
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

253
002253.21,,.603 => 003.25: 23,355
Glaring.

254
00225523, 856 ==> 0025: 25,523
Okay.

255
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,822
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

256
00225:38,579 --> 00:25:40,372
Keller.

257
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:46,754
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

258

Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

260
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,229
Yeah.

261
002263 05,397 ==> 00726: 09,026
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

262
00226:09,193 ==> 00:26:13,655
How about if I just push 28,800...

263
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:19,369
...out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

264
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:30,214
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

265
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,299
Fair enough.

266
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,343
I'll take care of it.

267
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,594
Thank you for the heads-up.

268
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,807
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

269
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,019
What if your kids found out?

270
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:52,694
-If my kids found out?
-This. What you're doing.

Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

272

Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

273
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,210
I guess maybe I'd....

274
00%27:08,919 ==> 00:27:12,339
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...

215
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,967
..-but that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

276
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,720
You know, trying to provide.

277
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:23,641
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand....

278
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,606
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

279

I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, SoO....

280
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,113
I'd better get back to it.

281
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,999
Oh, God.

I'm at work right now--

284

What?

285
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,136
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

286
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,387
No, no, no, of course.

287
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,098
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

288
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,935
-I'll bring him anywhere you want.
-Dad.

289
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,314
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

290

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,984

I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now.

291
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,486
But wouldn't it be easier if we--?

 

292

00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:21,033
Right, okay, good.

So we'll meet you at the house.

she has her reasons.

Well, they're....

00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,022
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

301
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:58,403
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

302
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,865
But Shes we.

303
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,452
Yeah.

304
002293 07,204 ==> 002293 12,125
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

305;
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:17,089
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

...everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

309

Everybody is on your side.

310
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:40,195
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

311
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,074
-How can you let her treat you like this?
-Come on.

32
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,578
-How can you just take it?
-Now just listen to me, okay?

313
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,958
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

314
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,129
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

315

You and your sister will
come first always.

316
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,053
Come on.

 

317
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:13,395
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

318

00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,277
And I'll take you home.

320
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:29,036
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

321
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,930
Hello. Good afternoon.

322
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,558
-Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
-Nice to meet you.

323
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,395
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

324
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,773
Better call Saul!

325
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,901
I get it all the time.

326
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,572
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

327
00231706,114 => 00731209,159
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

328
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,079
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

329
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,874
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

330
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,584
However, for our purposes...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
331
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,129
...you might just as well visualize
a large bag of money.

332
00231:21,296 =-> 00:31:25,592
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

333
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,553
-Cash?
-Cash. I know, in this economy.

334
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,556
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

335
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,060
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

336
O02 312 35,227 => 00331937, 771
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

337
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:42,067
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarized...

338
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,069
..we can take care of this right now.

339
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,114

In fact, I could wire you your money

this very afternoon.

 

 

340
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,909
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

341
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,120
The price.

342

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,876
We feel 875 is very fair.

343
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,338
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

344
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:09,594
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

345
002322 10,220 => 00:322 13, 554
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

346
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,767
No, that's my offer.

347
00%32:15,934 ==> 00:32:18,186
That's less than half-price.

348
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,439
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

349
00232 $20,605 == 002325 22,399
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

350
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,652
..-and you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

351
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,488
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

352
00232 $28,655 == 00325 29,990
-Waste of time.
-Ridiculous.

353
00232:30,157 =-> 00:32:32,617
How could you possibly imagine

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
we'd entertain this?

354
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,161
-Come on, hon.
-I don't know.

355
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,664
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

356
002322 37,831. => 00332: 39,374
That used to be in the basement.

357
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,627
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

358
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,255
...and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

359
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,717
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

360
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,302
But no meth lab.

361
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:56,016
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

362
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:01,563
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

363
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,024
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

364
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,901
I mean, good try...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
365
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,404
..-at sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

366
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,200
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

367
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:18,830
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

368
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,249
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

369
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,544
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

370
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,215
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?

371
002333 50,070 == 002333 51,112
There you go, son.

372
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,909
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

373
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,500
Okay.

374
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,054
-Oh, hey.
-Hello.

375
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,854
-Brought pizza.
-Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

376
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:30,610

Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

377
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,031
Hi, honey.

378
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,662
Sorry.

379
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,251
Skyler.

380
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:52,340
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

381
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,761
I mean, can't we at least just sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

382
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,806
Just hash things out like adults?

383
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,645
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

384
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,732
I thought I made myself very clear.

385
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,654
I got dipping sticks.

386
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,654
You've reached Walt's
temporary number.

387
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,656
Please, leave a message.

388
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,912
When I went out this morning

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
to get the newspaper...

389
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,124
...-I saw a pizza on our roof.

390
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,960

Would you know anything about that?

391
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,422
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.

392
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:00,385
Calm down, accept the situation
and keep your distance.

393)
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:05,265
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.

394
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,567
Skyler. Skyler.

395
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,697

Got your restraining order right here!

Restrain this!

396
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,464
Breaking even is not so bad.

397
002374375630 ==> 00237: 40,717
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

398
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:46,765
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to Space Camp.

399
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,018
Oh, no.

400
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,855

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Oh, God. This is all we need.

401
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,152
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?

402
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,406
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

403
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,074
Come on.

404
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,203
Jesse, the house has been sold.

405
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,371
The new owners are expected
at any moment.

406
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,041
-Where do you think you're going?
-Inside.

407
00#38:15,001. => 00:38:16, 961
I bought the place.

408
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,186
Be back by 7, okay?

409
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,188
Love you.

410
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,487
Bye.

411
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55, 346
No!

412
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,099
Oh, God.

 

413
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,797

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,949
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,118
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,872
Lots of time.

30
00#02:02,539 => 00:02:07,377
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always--

31
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,837
Finishes first.

32
00202:09,171 ==> 00:02:11,298
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,801
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah?

35
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,389
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,727
They flow like a waterfall.

 

37
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25, 646
I like that about you.

38
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:35,864
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

No, I feel terrible.

00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,703

to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,497
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,748
Present?

43
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,834
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

44
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,253
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,340
I have it for you in the back.

46

I love it!

50
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,619

56

He's still breathing.

57
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,158
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

58
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,163
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

59.

Son of a bitch.

Hang on, baby.

Hello.

63
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,948
Walt? Are you in the house?

64
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,537
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

65
00206312,371 =-> 00:06:14,916
What? What the hel
are you doing in there?

66
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,626
I'm back.
67

 

00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,421
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

68
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,299
You're not back.
Get-- Get out of there.

69
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,759
-Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
-No--

70
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,804
I'm staying. End of story.

71
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,433
-We had an agreement.
-I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,769
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

73
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,814
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

74
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:42,485
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,115
Well, suit yourself.

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,992

Walt?

78
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,854
What is wrong with you?

719
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,442

-Skyler, I have every right to be here.

-No, you don't.

80
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,862
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

81
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,782
-I don't agree to a divorce.
-Well, it's not up to you.

82
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,163
If you don't get out of here right
I'm gonna call the police...

83
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,959
-and I'm going to tell them
everything.

84
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,795
I mean it, Walt.

85
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,883
There's the phone.

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,070
It's ringing.

Yes, I want to report a disturbance,

No, no, it's not--
It's not exactly, it's....

92
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,682
It's a domestic issue.

93
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,809
Okay.

94
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,939
They're connecting me.

95
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,527
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

96

Do what you have to do, Skyler.

97
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,784
This family is everything to me.

98
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59, 622
-Without it, I have nothing to lose.
-Fine.

99
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04, 961
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

100

How are you?

Are you back for good?

-Why are you home so soon?
-I'm not.

112

Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,238
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

116
002102 55,488 => 00s1.12 00,577
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

117
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,328
-Walter?
-How was school?

118
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,247
-It was good.
-Yeah? Homework?

119
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,709
-No, not really.
-Not really? What does that mean?

120
00: 217,510 --> 00:11:19,888
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

121
00211 220,054 =-> 00211: 22,265
Yeah, that's the plan.

122
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,907
Hello, ma'am.

We were called about a disturbance?

 

 

 

 

123
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,286
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but....

124
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,914

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Yeah, that was me.

125
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,543
You called the cops on Dad?

126
O08117¢55,256 ==> 003118 57,467
I came home from work
and he was back.

127
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,969
He had just moved back
into the house.

128
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:06,434
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. just....

129
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,480
I want him out.

I want him out of the house.

130
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,150
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

 

134.
O02T2 $14,317 == 002125 16,152
It's very important
you answer honestly.

132
00#812:16,402 => 00:122 19,322
-Did he strike you?
-No.

133
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,660
-Has he ever hit you?
-No. This is not about violence.

134
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,995
This is about trespassing.

135
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,959
-About him being here against my will.
-Okay. Trespassing.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

136
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,753
-You're divorced, then?
-No, working on it.

137
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,591
-Right now, were separated.
-Legally separated?

138
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,177
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

139
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,265
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

140
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,018
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

141
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,020
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

142
00212 s51, 787 ==> 00212254,.524
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

143
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,318
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

144
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59, 988
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

145
00%13200,154 ==> 00:13:02,031
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

146
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:08,204
No. Not physically.

But having him in the house is just....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
147
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,293
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

148
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:19,882
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

149
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,721
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

50
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,307
That was it.

51
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:32,020
-I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
-Disagreements.

 

52

00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,857
Yes, well,

we've had our share of that.

153
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:41,404
I haven't.... I haven't been

the most attentive husband lately.

54
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:48,369
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

55
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:58,046
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

56
00:13:58,212 =-> 00:13:59,756
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

 

57
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02, 633
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

158
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06, 387

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

159
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,767
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

160
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,519
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

61
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15, 938
I'll get him out of the house for you.

62
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,107
What's your take on all this?

63
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,152
It's my mom's fault.

64
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:28,951
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

 

 

 

65

00214 429,118 ==> 00214: 31, 621
I don't know why

she's being this way.

66
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:37,085
My dad, he is a great guy.

67
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,963
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

68
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,257
Mrs. White.

 

69
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,763
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

 

 

170
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,724

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

171
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,812
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

112
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,565
..-you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

173
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,984
I'd really look into
some counseling.

74
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,238
Best of luck to you folks.

75

00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,074

Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

 

76

00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,668
Why you gotta--?

Why you gotta do this to Dad?

177
00:15:18,835 -->. 00:15: 22,922
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

78
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,928
Sorry.
79

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,197
Welcome home.

80
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,910
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

 

81

00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,496

-Don't look so glad to see me.
-Thanks.

182
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,541
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

183
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,045
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

184
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:49,759
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

185
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,597
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

186
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,058
...Since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

187
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,603
You realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

188
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,438
What if I was trying to warn you...

189
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,108
...that the DEA was gonna kick down

your door? What then?

190
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,362
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

 

 

191
00217:09,529 =-> 00:17:11,614
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

192
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,785
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

193

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,454
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

194
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,207
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

195
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,209
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

196
00#817223,376 “> OOr17's 271,088
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

97
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,299
So, what do you say?

98

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,761
-Sure, man. Whatever.
-Okay. Whatever what?

 

99
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,389
I mean, you gonna call him?

200
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,726
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

201
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,770
Final thought.

202
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,733
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

203
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,154
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

204
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,740
Call him.

00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,665
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

206
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,875
"Do Not Call list."

207
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,669
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

208

Schrader.

209
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,488
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

210
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,158
Yeah?

211
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,414
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

212
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,043
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

213
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,045
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

214

..-I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

 

 

215
00819: 38,052 <> 00:19: 41,055
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

216

Merkert called in a couple of favors.

Gentlemen. Welcome.

Thank you for coming.

222
00822211, 714.7 > 002222 13,582
Any difficulty at the border?

223
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,086
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

224
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,005
Please, come in.

225
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,926
I apologize that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

226
0022235,813 --> 00322: 36,897
My apologies, Gustavo.

227
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,358
Of course,
you should have been advised.

228
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,612
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

Bute sss

230
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:49,243
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

231
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,912
Indeed, he is.

232
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,291
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

233
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,127
I don't know him by that name,
but yes.

234
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,296

I've made no secret of the fact that...

235
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,842
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

236
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,722
You and I,
we still make money together.

237
002232 LO, 7123 ——> 00223914, 977
It's never affected our relationship.

238
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,481
Don Salamanca had
a nephew named Tuco.

239
00223:19,648 =-> 00:23:22,109
Yes, I knew of him.

240
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,404
Then perhaps you know Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

241
OOS238¢2 27,072 --> 007233 29,658
Thought of Tuco as a son.

242
00223229,.992 => 00:23:35,122
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

243
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,500
He was a key man in our
organization north of the border.

244
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,836
He was loyal.

245
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,672
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

246
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,424
...he was one of
Tuco's local suppliers.

247
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
Until he betrayed Tuco.

248
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:54,099
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

249
002232 55,309 <-> 0.0::23257,:019
Tuco's cousins here...

250
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58, 896
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

25.1
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,690
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

252
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,777
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,991
Gentlemen.

255
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,494
I feel your loss deeply.

256

Please accept my condolences.

257

I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

258
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:29,677
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

259
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,055
When our business is done...

260
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:38,060
...-he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

261
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,648
Until then...

262
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,069
...I need him alive.

263
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,868
Excuse us.

264
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,928
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

265
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,598
You should really leave matters
of my organization's politics to me.

266
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,227
Do I not run my own territory?

267
002254.20,394 == 00225: 21,770
Of course you do.

268
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,023
And I will advise them to be patient.

269
002253245789 ==% 00225: 27,525
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

270
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,528
Or you risk losing
the good graces of the cartel.

271
00:25: 31,030 --S 00°25: 32,781
That would not be wise.

272
00225:35,993 =--> 00:25:38,412
And those boys inside...

273
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,206
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

274
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,793
They are not like you and I.

275
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,320
If you're trying to sell me something,

Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

I've got you. Yes. Yes.

Skyler? Want some help?

287
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,178
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

288
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,901
God--

289
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,963

=Yesi.

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,842
Very much against my will.
He just-- He showed right back up.

29.1,
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,180
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

292
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,309
I called the police on him.

293
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,853
I was so clo--

294
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,358
-So close to what?
-Nothing. Never mind.

295
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59, 988
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

296
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,533
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

297
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,869
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

298
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,331
I can't tell a sou
unless you authorize me to.

Even if it's something illegal?

300

I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

302
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,853
My husband makes meth.

303
002294 33,7712 ==> 002293 35,983
Methamphetamine.

304
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,989
-Your husband's a drug dealer?
-A manufacturer, technically.

305
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:47,160
They.... They call them cooks.
306

00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49, 663
I looked it up on the Internet.

307
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,709
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

308
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,586
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

309
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,382
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

310
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,011
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

I can't.

315

I can't do it.

His treatment bought him some time.

But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later....

323
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:58,231
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

-What are we doing in this shithole?

-Relax, will you?

Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

-We should have went to Chili's, man.
-All right, already. Jesus.

So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

335
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,366

I'd be dying to get back in the action.

It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

What are you talking about?

340

Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

341

I'm gonna hit the head.

Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

343
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,757
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

344

-All right.

-What you doing?

345

So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

Crap.

00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,302
There's an ATM right outside.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55, 889
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,977
Well, you can write a personal check

You think I could just
come back later?

8
002012 07,985 ==> 00801211,029
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,160
If it were me, I'd be totally,

you know, "No problem."

It's awesome.

Everything's maximum interesting.

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:29,399
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

28
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,072
It's awesome.

29
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,701
Come on. What do you say?

30
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,444
Have a nice day.

31
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,819
So how does it feel?

32
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,612
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,157
Yeah, it's tight.

34
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,660
-Yeah, but is it painful?
-It's hard to breathe.

35
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,164
Well, you need your breathing.

36
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,042
Although let's not lose sight
of ‘the fact...

37
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,671
...that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio...

38
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,382
...SO some discomfort is

to be expected.

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,891
Let's go with that one.

40
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,355
A cashier's check, por favor.

41
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,568
Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

42
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,361
Victims' families would be great.

43
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,198
I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

44
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,576
Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

45
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,161
Trouble?

46
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,706
Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.

47
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,210
-That guy is a joke.
-You know what? You called my bluff.

48
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,669
What does that even mean?

49
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,006
You dared me to tell the police
and I couldn't do it, so you win.

00#04:58,173 => 00:05: 01,593

but we are not married anymore.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,180
I told you that
I was done cooking meth, Skyler.

52
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,890
-I promised you that.
-So what?

53
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,559
You know what?
At least I didn't run off to go--

54
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,021
Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,
I did for this family.

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,274
-Just keep telling yourself that.
-What is that supposed to mean?

56
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,193
You don't like it, then leave.

57

-That's what you want.

You think this will get me
to move out?

62
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,461
Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.

63
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,421
Suit yourself.

64
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,216
Is this a good or bad thing?

65
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,928
Suit myself.
You want me to suit myself?

66
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,930
I'll suit myself to his face!

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,266
It's a bad thing.

68
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,611
Hello.

69
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,614

Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

Mr.

I

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,785
I'm sorry.
Beneke's on a conference call.

71
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,789
Okay. I will wait.

72
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,916
It could be a while.

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,086
have all the time in the world.

74
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,738
Okay.

75
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,491
-Here we go. Okay.
-Excuse me.

76
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,827
-Mr. Beneke's not available.
-Ted? Come on.

77
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,746
Sir, excuse me.

78
00:06:53,997 =-->. 00:06: 55,332
Excuse me.

719
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,167
Ted, I can see you.

80
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,836
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

81
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,046
Now, come on.

82
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,134
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

83
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,887
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

84
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,558
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

85
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,477
Oh, yes, you are.

86

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,354
So open the door.

87
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,856
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

88
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,525
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

89
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24, 861
Open the door, Ted, right now.

90
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,033
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

91
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,036
We have a situation.

92
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,710
Walt. Walt. Walt.

93
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,171
What are you doing?

94
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,048
I'm talking with Ted.

95
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,772
Next time, you'll open the door.

96
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,609
-Freeze! Come on.
-Oh, damn it.

97
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,194
No, I'm just here to talk.

98
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,613
-I just want to talk to him.

100

-Calm down.

-I'm just-- Okay, all right.

00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,039

All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

102

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,542

Asshole.

103

00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,396
What do you want?
What do you want?

04
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,441
Hey! Hey, come on.
05

00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,319
What the hell is wrong with you?

06
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,947
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

 

07
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,784
I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

108
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,246
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,459
-I just wanted to talk to him.
-Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

110

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,586
Consider this an intervention.

111
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,505
You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

112
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,759
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

LS:
00709:10,925 --> 00:09:13,136
But speaking as
your business associate...

114
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,139
...I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

115
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:21,644
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

116
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,649
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity...

117
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,528
...to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

118
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,782
-How did you know?
-Sorry?

119
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,493
About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

120
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
How did you know?

121
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,707

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

122
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,002
-The lesson here should be--
-Did you bug my house?

123
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,717
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

124
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,512
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

125
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,681
-I told you to?
-You strongly hinted that I should.

126
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,894
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

127
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,690
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

128
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,485
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

129
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,864
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

 

130
00%10:15,031, =—> 00:10:17,075
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt...

131
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,204
..-which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

I can't begin to understand

..with all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

163
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,625
But still, as educators...

164
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,837
...there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here...

 

65
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,799
«s.to the school
and to the students themselves.

66
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,551
Of course.

67
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,348
Is this a wheaten terrier?

see if we can't find this M-named clown.

326
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,502
What? It's a lead.

327
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,505
-Lead to what?
-To Heisenberg.

328
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,134
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

329
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,219
Here we go, my friend.

330
OOL27 217,886 <-> 00327: 19,471
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,

Gomey.

331
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,558
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

332
00227323, 517 S=> 00227325, 643.
Man, you're reaching.

333
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,898
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

334
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,693
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

335
00227:233,527 ==> 00227235,487
How do I know?

336
00:27:36,363 -->. 00°327:38,365
Because I know.

337
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,908
I don't get it.

338
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,412
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

339
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,497
Chase down teeners?

340
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,334
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

341
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,213
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation...

and ask for a transfer.

343
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,218
What is up with you lately?

344
00227758,385 ==> 00:28:02,097
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso...

345
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,681
...and now this bullshit?

346
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,810
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

347
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,229
Talk to someone?

348
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11, 689
Talk to who?

349
00228:15,235 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

350
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,909
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

351
00228322,075 ==— 00228225,-412
Appreciate that, bro.

352
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28, 832
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

353
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,265
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

354
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,435
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

355
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,605
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

356
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,816
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts...

357
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,153
...just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

358
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,906
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

35.9.
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,326
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

360
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:08,413
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

3161
00229308,580 ==> 00:29:10,916
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

362
00229:11,083 =-> 00:29:13,335
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

363
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,880
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had--

364

Hi, there.

365)
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,512
-How in the hell did you get Walt to--?
-I made it.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

366
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,974
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

367
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,842
Well, good news is...

368
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:06,346
...for a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

369
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,640
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

370
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,352
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

3871
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,482
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

372
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,197
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

373
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,534
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

374
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,747
-The scythe.
-Animals.

375
002302 31,955 <-> 00:30: 33, 582
-Does the lawyer know?
-Should he?

376
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,375
No.

377

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,548
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

378
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,092
You stand between him
and an ax in the head.

379
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,845
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

380
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,889
I want investment.

381
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,726
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

382
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,854
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

383
008308 56,271 -—> 00:31201, 610
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

384
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,405
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know...

385
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,283
...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

386
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:12,079
-I don't work with junkies.
-That's what I thought you'd say.

 

 

387
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,081
Probably for the best.

388
00#31:14,247 => 00:31216,583

he and Walter are splitsville.

389
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,753
Really?

390
00%31719,920 ==> 003318 23,,382
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

391
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,594
Do the deal.

392
00232 $53,305 ==> 00732: 56,683
You have one unheard message.

393
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,604
Agent Schrader, you need
to be calling me back ASAP.

394
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,441
I've got Texas breathing down
my neck and I'm not about--

395
00233225,962 => 00:33: 29, 758
No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.

396
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,801
Where can I find him, you think?

397
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,971
-No idea. Haven't seen him.
-I know. You said that a few times.

398
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:39,768
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

399
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,108
-What's your name, darling?
-Cara.

400
00233:53,073 --> 00:33:55,575
Where did this come from, Cara?

401
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,620
I don't know.

402
00233458,912 ==> 00734: 01,790
What is it? Drugs?

403
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,420
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

404
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,465
You're a bad liar, Cara.

405
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,011
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've ever seen.

406
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,141
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

407
00234 420,308 ==> 00734: 25,397
Still, you're not a very good liar.

408
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,150
-I honestly don't know--
-Stop.

409
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,487
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

410
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,533
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

411
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,666
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
412
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,169
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

413
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,338
-Okay, and who gave it to you?
-Some guy.

414
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54, 634
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

415
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,846
Some guy? What's his name?

416
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,309
Okay, what--? What did he look like?

417
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,062
I don't know.

418
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,231
He looked pretty normal.

 

419
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,859
You know, white.

420
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,866
I think his hair was lightish brown.

421
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,036
He had really blue eyes.

422
00235:21,.202 => 00:35: 23,538
They were really, really blue.

423
00235:23,705 --> 00:35:26,499
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

424
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:31,588

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Piercings, jewelry, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

425
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,215
Come on.

426
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,218
Listen to me.

427
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,222
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

428
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,726
So if you can remember
anything else....

429
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,982
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

430
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,486
He drove an RV.

431
002354 55,195 ==> 00735: 56, 696
Okay, good, good.

432
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,074
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

433
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,118
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

434
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:07,916
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

435
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,089
But the color was,
I think, white, brownish color.

00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,884
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,261
I know I'm not helping you...

438
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,891
-but, please, don't tell my dad.

439
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,819
Cara.

440
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:42,534
Please, tell me that
that camera works.

441
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,590
Damn it.

442
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,191
Bingo.

443
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,546
These eggs are good, Mom.

It's been three days

447
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:36,523
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

448
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,373
So how long are you off for?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,295
A few weeks.

450
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,298
I'll play it by ear.

451
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:11,099
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

452
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:24,612
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

453

Yeah.

Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?

455
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,298
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

456
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,601
Sometime, maybe.

457
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,438
Yeah, we'll see.

458
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,523
What's up?

459
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,156
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

460
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:10,551

462
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:21,270
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

463
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,232
That's right. It's your half.

464
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:31,030
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

465
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,369

I mean, the whole thing was crazy.

Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

 

 

466
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,456
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

4607
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,212
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

468
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,548
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

469
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,593
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

470
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,097
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

471
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,099
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

472
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,227

The teenth?

473
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,938

Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

474
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,442
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

475
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,279
The station's closed-circuit was down--
Surprise, surprise.

476
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:16,409
--but I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

4717
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,078
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

478
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,748
First off, your typical Class C
motor home...

479
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,792
..is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

480
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,629
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

481
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,424
See how high
that suspension's riding?

482
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:35,136
No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

483
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,140
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

There's no clear view of the plates.

487
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51, 486
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

488
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55, 323
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely New Mexico registration.

489
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,616
I check with DMV.

490
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:01,162
There are only 29 of these early-'80s
Bounders registered in the state.

491
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,459
-Only 29?
-Yeah.

492
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:09,921
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

493
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,430
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

494
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,351
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

495
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,978
-You're refusing the assignment.
-I'm not. I'll go.

You're out of time.

499
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:38,699
Are you going to El Paso now,
tonight?

500
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,081
It's a simple yes or no.

501
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:56,384
No. I can't.

502
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:04,559
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

503
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,904

Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

It's a thermostat.

I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

71

Yeah, I'll be right there.

You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

Yeah, right, like you don't know.

-What did I just say?
-Give me the phone. Give it.

82
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,423
Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

83
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28, 383
Correct. I did not.

84
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,385
I was sitting at a stoplight...

85
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,596

Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

88

-Let me talk to him.
-I owe you?

89
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,106
I owe you nothing.

90
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,525
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

9.1
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,694
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

92

Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

93
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,449
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

94
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,286
I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

95
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,040
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

96
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,249
Plural, bitch.

97
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,252
You did not have my permission.
98
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,088
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due...

99
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,757
»..and you got the rest.

100
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,550
Escalating. You're escalating.

0.1,
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,387
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

102

Can't see a damn thing.

I ain't feeling it.

105

00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,508
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

 

106
00%10733,675 ==> 003108 37,720
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

107
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,057
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

108

Nope.

-Want me to make you breakfast?
“No. I's ws «

136
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,242
I'm heading back out after this.

137
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,662
Now? You worked all night.

138
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,582
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

39
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,502

They're recreational vehicles, Marie.

That's what they do.

40
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,504
You know what I mean.

41
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,508
I spoke with Blanca.

 

42
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,430
She said

that Steven's going to El Paso?

143
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,726
Yeah.

144
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,272
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

145
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,735
-I turned it down. End of story.
-Good. Good.

00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,570
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

147
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,032
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation...

148
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,618
...and couldn't do both...

149
00#14 228,785 <> 00s142 31,120
...So I made a judgment call.

150
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,047
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

151.
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,800
You don't have
to go through this alone.

152
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,471
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone...

153
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,306
...before you nuke them?

154
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,933
Jesus, Marie.

155
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,604
I made a decision.

I'm not going through anything.

 

 

156
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,815
Doing my job.

157
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,442

-I know. I know.

A condo in Georgetown. I know.

159
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,156
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say...

160
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,494

...I'd like to be included. That's all.

161
OO#15: 1L,661 <> 00s15: 15,706
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

162
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,752
Did you not wanna go?

163
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't blame you. I just--

164
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,301

-Aren't you late for work or something?

-After what happened...

165
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30, 388
..it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

166
00215:30,555 --> 00:15:33,099
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

167
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,186
Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to
do with it. Anyone who doubts that....

168
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39, 605
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here...

169
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,942
...and all I get

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

are these bullshit accusations!

170

00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,112

What,

everyone thinks

I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

 

 

 

 

71
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,030
But I'm onto something. I know it.
72
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,324
You understand me?
73
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,869
You hear me?
74
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,044
What exactly is this?
75
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,469
I'll tell you what I think it is.
76
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,892
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.
177
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17, 643
And an obvious one at that.
178
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
How do you mean?
179
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:25,485

As if I would serious
you would hire an addict.

No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

183
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,541
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

184
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,087
Trusting him with a solo venture...

185
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,591
...well, that's quite another matter.

186
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,178
How he could possibly
produce anything...

187
00216352,345 ==> 0016: 55,348
...other than a mediocre product

at best.

 

 

188

I am told his product
was more or less consistent...

00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,896
..with the quality
I had come to expect.

190
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,440
More or less?

191
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,110
More or less? Really?

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,713
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

195
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,219
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness...

196
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,555
...about my own formula.

197
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,227
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose...

198
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:46,148
...that you think
simply overwhelms me...

199

Hi. Is everything okay?

206

She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

207
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,519
Then she fell asleep.

208
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,564
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

 

209

Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

I shouldn't be much longer.

-It's Hank.
-Hank? What about him?

221:
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,782
I don't know how to talk to him.

222
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,744
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to....

223
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:09,083
Ever since El Paso, ever since--
Maybe before....

224
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,879
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

225
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,426
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere...

226
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,888
...and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

227
00#202.23,055 —<—> 00:20:24,098
Yeah?

228
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:28,102

is going in his place...

229

..-and I don't know
how I feel about that.

230
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,776

Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,

isn't he?

231
002.203 35,943 =->. 00320: 39,655
Of course, and I want him safe.

232
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:44,118
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

233
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,246
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

234
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,999
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

235
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,169
It's like something's
eating him away from inside.

236
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,298
He's just not the same. He's not.

237
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,012
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

238
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,141
I guess you've noticed
a change in Walt.

Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

of this reaction vessel.

245
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,530
Oh, it's got....
It's gotta be 1200 liters.

246

Where--? Where--?

247
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,206
How did you know
how to put this all together?

248
00224 417,373 ==> 00224: 21,168
I had excellent help, as will you.

249
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,715
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

250
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,259
I would say so.

251
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,305
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

252
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,392
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis...

253

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,893
...detergents and such.

254

There is nothing suspicious
about atau.

255
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,193
...and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

256
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,822
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

257
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,242
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam...

258
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,244
...-jJust as the laundry does...

259

265

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

002253 36,869 ==> 00225: 39,121
The answer is still no.

266
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:49,798
I have made a series
of very bad decisions...

267
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,301
...and I cannot make another one.

268
00225:52,468 =-> 00:25:54,428
Why did you make these decisions?

269
00225:54,970 --> 00:25:56,972
For the good of my family.

270
O0225:57,598 => 00:26:00, 976
Then they weren't bad decisions.

271
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,273
What does a man do, Walter?

272
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,154
A man provides for his family.

273
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,157
This cost me my family.

274
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17, 993
When you have children,
you always have family.

 

275
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,497
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

 

276
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,376
And a man.... A man provides.
277

00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,174
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated...

He simply bears up, and he does it...

281
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,813
...because he's a man.

282
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,584
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

283
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,379
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

284
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,133
I really gotta head home.

285
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,302
All right, rain check, then.

286
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,534
She said it was the tofu.

287
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46, 832

Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,247
Okay. Okay, thanks.

Hey, Janice. Janice.

Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

Okay, I'll check.

Hey, how are you guys doing?

308

00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,801

Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

-Fight the good fight, brother.
-I will.

319

Who got a drink around here?

320
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,238
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

321.
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,615
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed...

322
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,870
...-but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

323
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,414
No police report, either.

I'm doing anymore, you know?

That's a lie. I do know why.

336

I mean, he's a lovely guy.

337

Your husband, the drug dealer?

363

How much money?

364
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49, 332
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

A bag, where he keeps it.

Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

No. God, no. I just--

that I'm half as qualified...

There is nothing to discuss here.

I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

He's the father of my children...

He did it for the family. Right?

Okay.

379

I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

380
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:41,760
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

381
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,262
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

382

You are now an accessory
after the fact.

You are culpable.

-Can you take a Xanax?

Because I got a drawer full of them.

396
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,552
I get them from my "chiropractor."

You're late.

408

Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

409
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,556
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

410
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:37,602
This young man is prepared

to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...

411
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,105
-...for doing precisely nothing.
-Really?

412
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:46,069
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:50,281
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

414
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,118
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution...

415
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,122
...to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

416
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,376
That's charity, is what that is.

417
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,086
I do all the work.

418
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,089
He sits around on his fat ass

419
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,926
Escalating. Stop.

420
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,721
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

421
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,141
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate...

422
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,936
..-when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

423
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,690
He must not have realized that you
two had come to a parting of the ways.

424
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,609

Take it. It belongs to you.

426
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,490
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's--

427
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,076
-That almost brings a tear to my eye.
-Enjoy it.

428
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,578
Spend it in good health.

429
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,375
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

430
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,169
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

431
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:52,301
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate...

432
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,514
-was only using you to get to me.

433
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,016
What are you talking about?

 

434

00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,645
See, he needs someone

with expertise...

 

435
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,523
...someone who knows
what he's doing.

436

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,318
In other words, he needs me.

437

You're telling me
you're cooking again?

438
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,783
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

439
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,037
I'm in.

What was the offer, if I may ask?

443
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:37,138
It's 3 million
for three months of my time.

444
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,349
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

445
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,851
What was our deal before?

446
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,145
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

447
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47, 648
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

-Five.

452
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,825
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,058
..-but don't even think
about using my formula.

461
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,394
Just try and stop me, bitch.

462
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,489
-Yes?
-Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

463
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,658
-Yes.
-Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

464
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,578
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

465
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,248
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

466
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,169
-Do you have an RV?
-I did.

467
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,171
It was stolen months ago.

468
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,174
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

469
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,178
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

470
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43, 306
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

471
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,267
I just didn't get around to it.

472
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,352
May I ask why?

473
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,356
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together...

474
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,025
...for an affordable vacation.

475
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,319
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

476
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,112
It was.

477
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,491
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

478
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,330
I didn't want him arrested.

479
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,959
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

480
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,587
I thought he could turn
his life around.

481
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,547
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

482
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,799
My son.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

483
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,011
I'd really like to speak with him.

484
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:27,058
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

485
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,062
-What was your son's name?
-Christian.

486
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,689
Christian Ortega.

487
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,902
Was his nickname Combo?

488
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,372
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.

-She all right?
-Her daughter called from California.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,437
She hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.

Will do.

-I found the papers.

00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,221
Right where you left them,
in the crib.

Yeah, well....

You know best, right?

00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,812
Anything else?

32
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,605
Do you have any thought...

33
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:19,402
..-about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr.?

34
00205:19,569 ==> 00:05:21,279
Well, he's still my son.

 

35.
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,490
-I mean, he will remain--
-Of course.

36
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26, 868
My point being...

37
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29, 329
...the divorce.

I mean, I--

41
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,759
I think he saw it coming.

42
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,053
He sees your unhappiness and--

43
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,055
My unhappiness?

44
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50, 349
My completely out-of-the-clear...

45
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54, 646
...blue-sky unhappiness?

46
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,481
Really?

47
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,776
Look, as you said, for the best.

48
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,319
Yeah.

49
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,154
Okay.

50
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,783
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

51
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,997
In the child-support worksheet,
you list medical, dental...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

52
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:18,377
...child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

53
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,046
That's right, all of it.

54
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23, 633
Walt.

55

00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,179
-No.

-Skyler, you wanted me out...

56
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,182
-.-I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

57
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,435
Not with that money.

58
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36, 688
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

59
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,567
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

60
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,531
I have to go.

61
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,783
Yep, I was right.

62
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,453
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,497
I can call over, get you in

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

to see any of the others.

64
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,333
No, no, this one's fine.

65
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,668
I'll take it.

66
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,175
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so--

67
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,843
Yeah, I like it.

68
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,845
I like everything about it.

69
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,015
I'll take it as-is.

70
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,563
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

71
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,365
-You have to clean the fryer.
-Yes,, sir.

72
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,662
We try to clean them every night...

73
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,707
...but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

74
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,045
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

75
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,714
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,927
...Clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

77
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
Main valve on, main switch on.

78
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,516
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

79
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,696
Yo, for real?

80
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,281
-This is all you?
-All me.

81
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,617
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

82
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,786
My man Jesse can cook.

83
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,747
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

84
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,250
-Just the right shade of blue.
-Good shade.

85
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,420
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

86
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,589
-...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
-Be my guest.

87
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

You sure?

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,140
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

89
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,768
No. I can watch, yo.

90
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,230
-I can cook and I can watch.
-Go for it.

91
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,566
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

92
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,943
Go easy.

93
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,612
Okay.

94
00#09:07,130 => 00:09: 08,423
Riverdance.

95
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,634
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

96
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,766
Bow before me.

97
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,644
I am Lord of the Dance.

98
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,147
Shit.

99
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,815

00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,901
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

101
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,653
That is awesome, Jesse.

102
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,034
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot--

03
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,328
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

04
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40, 663
Like anthrax.

05
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,166
Good.

06
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,126
So...

07
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,462
-you ready to talk some business?

 

08

00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52, 634

You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

109
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,304
I know...
110

00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58, 389
..-what you're thinking.

LLL
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,851
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

112
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04, 646

Badger, go see Clovis.

127
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,904
Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

Cautious.

-Right on.
-You got it.

Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,252
Just have him put in
one of those too.

33
00: 209,419 --> 00: 211,754
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

 

 

 

 

 

 

34
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,965
I'll get you a list.
35
00: 214,132 --> 00: 2 15,1633
Right on.
36
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,594
Yeah?
37
00: 217,886 --> 00: 720,096

-Yeah.
-All right.

138
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,725
So...

139)
00211 $23,892 ==> 00211: 25,476
-...we good?
~Yeah.

140
00%11:25,643 =-> 00:11:26,728
Good?

141
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,272
-All right.
-Let's do this thing.

42
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,456
Brandon Mayhew.

43
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48, 666
I know you.

44
OO#11: 49,792 => 00211252, 795
Small world, Albuquerque.

45
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,400
Wanna talk about it?

46
00%12755,942 ==> 00:12358,820
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

47
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,615
You know, ironically...

 

48
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06, 995
...I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

 

 

149
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,246
Sure.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
150
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,957
Well, just as much of me at least.

151
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,002
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

152
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,629
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

153
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,799
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

154
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,430
I do feel guilty.

155
002133 30,226 == 002133 33,229
I am the man that I am, son...

156
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,734
...and there's plenty

that I would change about that, but....

157
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:44,991
Here we are,

and this is just what it is.

 

 

158
00313:50,538 =-> 00:13:52,290
You know what? Call me crazy...

 

159

00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,170
-but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

160
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,206
Morning.

161
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,874
They're back.

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
62
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,546
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

163
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,173
Why?

164
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,509
They're doing nothing wrong.

165
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay, let's put this on Table 33,
okay?

66
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,811
Hello there.

67
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,981
Mr. White, I presume?

68
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,192
Oh, yes. Hi.

69
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,818

70
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,113
Sorry. I'll be right down.

 

71
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,626
-Hi. Gale Boetticher.
-Hi.

 

 

172
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46, 339
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

173
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,548
Yes, I am.

174
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,176

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

175
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,970
I have my résumé here for you.

176
002163 55,781, == 00216: 58,017
I received my bachelor's degree
from UNM.

177
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,853
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

178
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,482
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in....

719
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,359
It's all right there.

80
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,820
"X-ray crystallography."

81
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,030
Really?
82

00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,868
I could talk about that for hours.

83
00277 16,0385 ==> 00217: 17,370
I would love to.

84
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,165
But first, I'm curious about this.

85
00277 £23,501, ==> 00817: 27,171
That's a little pet project of mine.

 

86
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,260
See, in my opinion,

it's all about the quinic acid level.

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
187
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,389
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per liter...

188
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,101
..-but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

89
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,520
Bitterness, yuck.

90
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,064
So I pull a mild vacuum.

91
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:50,528
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and....

92
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,702
Judge for yourself.

 

93
00818: 10,590 <> 00s182 12,592
Oh, my God.
94

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,936
My God, that is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

195
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,440
Sumatran beans...

196
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,901
..and I also have to give credit
to the grind...

197
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,779
-...but thank you, Mr. White.
-Walt.

198
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,032
Please, call me Walt.

00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,535
Why the hell are we making meth?

200

00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,648
Hey.
201

00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,358

Tell me...

202

00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,069

 

 

...with the phenylacetic acid
solution...

203
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,865
...you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

204
00220:00,032 =--> 00:20:03,703
...and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

205
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,749
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

206
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,545
...you get an oilier aqueous layer,

and hence--

207
00220312, 712 ==> 00°20214,.380
Better benzene extraction.

208
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,216
Exactly.

209
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,760
But actually, I prefer ether.

 

210
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,721
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

211
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,523
Gale, I'm wondering how you--

212
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,567
Ended up here.

213
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:41,073
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

214
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,245
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike each other as criminals.

215
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:52,418
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

216
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,587
.I suppose.

217
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,589
I'm definitely a libertarian.

218
00220357,465 ==> 00:20: 59,633
Consenting adults want
what they want...

 

219
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,304
...and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

220
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,265
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

221
00221506,432 ==" 002213 10,227
No added toxins or adulterants.

222
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,232
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

223
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,278
..-pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

224
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,156
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

225
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,241
...-kissing the proper behinds...

226
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:29,789
...attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

227
00%21:29,.955 => 00:21:31,457
You know that world.

228
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,503
That is not what I signed on for.

229
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,634
I love the lab.

230
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,262
Because it's all still magic.

23.1,
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,472
You know?

232
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,309
Chemistry?
233
008212 51,310 => 00s212 52,978
I mean...
234

00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,314
-once you lose that....

235
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,649

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

It is.

236
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,318
It is magic.

237
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,654
Tt Stild. is,

238
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,535
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

239
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,664
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

240
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,166
I don't know it.

241
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,668
Anyway....

242
00#22215,835 <> 003222 18,170
Well, can you recite it?

243
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,717
Pathetically enough, I could.

244
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,011
All right, well....

245
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,639
No, no, come on. Come on.

246
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,890
Yeah?

247
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,773
When I heard the learn'd astronomer

248
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:43,654

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
When the proofs, the figures
Were ranged in columns before me

249
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,532
When I was shown the charts
And the diagrams

250
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,367
To add, divide, and measure them

251
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,745
When I, sitting
Heard the astronomer

252
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:56,834
Where he lectured with much
Applause In the lecture-room

253
00:22:57,543 =-> 00:23:02,715
How soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick

254
009¢:23)3 02,882 =—> 0022305,.175
Till rising and gliding out

255
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,385
I wander'd off by myself

256
002233 07,553 =—> 00:23 211,389
In the mystical moist night-air

257
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,309
And from time to time

258
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:18,063
Look'd up in perfect silence
At the stars

259
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,572
Yes.

260
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,406

I am a nerd.

261
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,121
-Bravo.
-Thank you.

262
002234 37,082 == 00723: 38,584
Come on, Pinkman.

263
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,794
You little rat bastard.

264
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,256
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

265
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,670
-Hey, baby.
-Are you ever coming home?

266
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,171
Marie, I'm working.

267
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,131
Did you find it? The RV?

268
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,008
No. Working on it, so....

269
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,305
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

270
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,350
It's not simple. There's a thing
called the Constitution.

271
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,687
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

272
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,193
This kid, I swear to God,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I wish I just could....

273
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,487
This is that Pinkman character?

274
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,823
That's the one.

275
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,200
Positive the little bastard's
got an RV.

276
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,619
I just don't know where he keeps it.

277
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,373
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

278
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,377
..-I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

279
00#25:03,544 => 00:25:07,339
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

280
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:12,428
...but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

281
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14, 680
Possibly.

282
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,223
It's worth a shot.

283
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,183
Yeah?

 

284
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,186

Listen, I hate to bother you.

-Shoot.

290
003257 35,533 =-> 00:25739,'705
I only ask this because I'm at a,

I'm working a case and--

on the spot or make you uncomfortable.

293

Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

294

Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

...through your student,
Jesse Pinkman.

296

Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

297
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,105
...-he may have dealt you
a little weed.

-Hank--
-Just a little.

299
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,359
And I so do not care about that.

As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

301
00226: 11,904 => 00:26:13, 571
Like you said, cut to the chase.

302
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:19,119
Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?

303
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,374
You know, a recreational vehicle...

304
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:29,046
...you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

305
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,925
Why?

306
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,054
Long story, but I'm personally of the
opinion he's moved on from weed...

307
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:43,102
...and graduated to selling
crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.

YOi.

What, Mr. White?

311
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,441
How's my favorite genius?

312
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,318

-I'm listening.
-My brother-in-law...

What RV?

Our BV s ss

321
00:27:51,712 -->. 00:27:55,299
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

322
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,260
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

323
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:02,472
He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter
of time before he tracks it down.

324
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,309
So get rid of it!
What are you doing sitting there?

B25
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,021
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

326
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,107
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

327
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,611
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,451
And do what exactly?

330
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,161
I mean, what--?

331
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,540
The thing is the size of a--

It's RV-size.

333
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,836
I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?

334
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,463
I'm not David Copperfield.

335)
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,341
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

336
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,843

-Did you not plan for this contingency?

-No.

337
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,346
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

338
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,224
The Starship Enterprise
had a self-destruct button.

339
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,517
Okay. Shut up.

340
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50, 687
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

341
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:56,193
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

342
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,404
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

The DEA,

You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

I need your help, okay?

All right, just--

wipe this off the planet, no questions.

Call him.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

404
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,210
...-which means you're trespassing
on private property.

405
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,213
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked...

406
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,259
...which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

407
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:23,056
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counselor.

408
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:27,060
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

409
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,688
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

410
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,524
See these round rubber things?

411
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,025
Those are wheels.

412
00236:34,192 => 00:36:35, 694
This is a vehicle.

413
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,531
This is a domicile, a residence...

 

414
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:44, 661
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

415
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,872

Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,548
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

419

Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

Look at these.

What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

423
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:19,612
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

424
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,700
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

425
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25, 368
Call the Albuquerque police....

426
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:30,790

there before you took off the tape?

needs to be readily apparent.

450
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,205

00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,404
Is your wife Marie Schrader?

463
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,448
Yes, why?

464
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,826
I'm sorry to inform you your wife's
been in an automobile accident.

465
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,621
She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center...

466
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,165
...and should be arriving there
shortly.

467
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,589
-How is she? What's her condition?
-I don't have the current information.

468
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,759
But I think you might wanna get there
as soon as possible.

469
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,763
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

470
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,989
-Marie?
-I'm just checking in.

471
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,909
I'd love to have some idea of whether
I should cook dinner or not.

472
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,371
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

473
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,123
Why?

474
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,627
Hank?

475
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,005
What's up?

476
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,359

I told you before.

477
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,695
You will not kill Walter White.

478
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:03,034
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

479
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,702
We've waited long enough.

480
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,414
We won't wait any longer.

481
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,708
You'll have to.

482
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,586
The decision...

483
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,880
...is not yours to make.

484
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,888
Explain to me, why this man White?

485
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:30,394
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

486
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,440
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

487
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,693
Was there not another man...

488
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,238
..who pulled the trigger?

489
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,865

A DEA agent.

490
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,077
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

491
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,414
North of the border is my territory.

492
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,333
My say.

493
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,753
As a show of respect...

494
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,090
-I say yes.

495
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,144
The agent's name is...

496
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,230
...Hank Schrader.

497
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:21,737
May his death satisfy you.

I don't like him.

He was just having fun.

You'll get over it.

Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

No, no. A cold one.

21
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,430
This is what you wanted.

Your brother dead. Right?

23)
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,564
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

24

..if you want to save him.

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,656
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,035

Maybe less?

Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

Talk to my lawyer, all right?

31

You got my cell phone number,

Yes, sir.

If you're ready to talk...

37

...they wanna get a statement.

38

There it is.

42

Yo, Adrian.

Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

45
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05, 926
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

48
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,310
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

49
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18, 480
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman...

50
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,150
...for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

No thanks to you.

for a case like that.

130
00212:26,788 => 007212: 30,333
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

131
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,001
And him cooking again?

132
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,339
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

133
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:41,010
..what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honor among thieves.

 

 

00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,264
Except for us, of course.

35
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,765
No, he'll--
36

00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,977
He'll come around.

37
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,604
And if he doesn't...

 

38
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,274
...there may come a time
to talk options.

Options?

140
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,250
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

141
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,753
..in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

142
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,089
...specifically what we call
the blue meth.

143
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,174
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

144
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,844
..where he stored

an early-'80s camper...

145
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,679
oo et. RV oo.

146
O0S1T33 25,179 == 008135 27,682
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

147
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,685
..-which I believe to be

a rolling meth lab...

 

 

148
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,354
...I received a telephone call...

149
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:38,443
...telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

150
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,902

to my wife.

3:48,661
I learned

the emergency call was a hoax.
153
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,248
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.
154
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,255
So immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
55
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,674
Most likely destroyed on site.
56
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,136
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?
57
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,857
I think we're done here.
58
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,611
Agent Schrader needs to get home...
59
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,820
...get some rest.
60
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,825

 

 

 

That's fine. But just to confirm,

you're taking the Fifth here?
161

00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,494

Yeah, that's correct.

162

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,496

Okay. Well...

...we just wanna give you all
a heads up.

164
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,044
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

165
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,382
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

166
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,883
The word of a meth head.

167
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,718
We know all about his history.

168
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,389
We're well aware,

but toxicology on Pinkman....

169
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,975
His blood is clean, he's not using.

170
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,229
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

71
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,189
...far as we can tell.

72
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,568
So...

73
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,197
.where do we go from here?

 

74
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,991
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down...

-Right. We just--

179

We need one more thing.

A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

81

Yes, of course.

82
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,600
Bandage off, if you would.

83
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,358
On the table is fine.

84
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,611
Flat on the table. That's fine.

Hi.

92
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,728
Do you have a minute?

93
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,938
Sure.

94
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,788
guess crime does pay.

 

95
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,463
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

 

 

196
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,301
No. We need to talk.

197
00218:56,093 =--> 00:18:58,012
You heard about Hank?

198
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,308
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

199
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,644
Yes, I know.

200
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,146
Whatever Hank was investigating...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
201
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,233
-him trying to find an RV...

202
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,152
-is there any danger...

203
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,738
...that could lead back to you?

204
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,115
No.

205
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,992
Why would it?

 

 

206
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,665
Is this why you're here?

207
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm here to talk about Hank.

208
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,342
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

 

 

209
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,180
Hank could lose everything.

210
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,185
I thought maybe...

211
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,564
...there's a way you could help him.

212
002193 51,023 == 002193 52, 650
How?

 

213
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,695
Contact Pinkman.

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
214
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,947
Get him to drop the charges.

215
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,368
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

216
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:07,039
-I'm not asking.
-He was-- He's-- He's not my friend.

217
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09, 667
-It's not as if we were even close.
-I '"m--

218
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,877
I'm not asking.

219
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,672
But there must be something
you could say.

220

Isn't it even worth a try?

221,
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,095
Hank is your family.

222
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,891
Not currently.

223
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,143
What?

224
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,146
I said, not currently.

225:
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,692

00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,460
A bit more professional.

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,088

I thought you might ask that.

241
002215575650 == 002213 58,692
Done.

242
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,822
That's good.

243
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,323

I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

249
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,380
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

250
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,885

but she wants to sleep before 10...

because traffic can be a wild card.

252
00223:11,265 => 00:23:15,728
Thing is, women who like to get peed on
tend to be from the warmer climates.

253
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,898
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

254
00223:19,064 => 00:23:21,483
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

255
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24, 987
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

I look like a TV weatherman.

You want a coffee?

No.

You want a glass of orange juice?

Here's what you'll tell them.

307

He attacked you.

308

-He attacked me?
-He swung at you with something.

309

-Swung at me?
-He attacked you with a pipe.

310

A pipe.

311
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:01,597
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

312
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,057
...and you had to disarm him.

Muscle memory.

Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

You had no choice but to hit him.

Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:55,888
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

 

 

471
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,182
.»..-SO Call me when you get this.

472
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00, 930
Finish him.

473
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,748
Jesus.

474
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,708
No.

475
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,296
Too easy.

Think you'll be okay

Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,840
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

So roll me further, bitch.

no visible exit wounds.

13
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,226
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,771
-What's his hemoglobin?
-Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,399
Need two large-bore IVs,

Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,447
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00203217,656 =-> 00:03:19,825
That's messed up.

22
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,494
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,496
Actually...

24
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,500
...I'm great.

00203251,523 ==> 00:03: 53,483
I don't understand.

26
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,861
I thought things
were going pretty well.

27
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,698
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03, 618
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,206
Not-- Not so much, no.

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,711
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen--

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,713
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,717
It's much more than that.

 

33
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,719
Could you elaborate?

 

34
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,430
Well, yes, of course I could...

35
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,225
...but I don't think either of us...

36
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,270
...would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged....

37
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,357
Yeah, SO% we. «

38
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,692
Yeah.

39
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,528
I set up the entire lab.

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,031
You said you liked the configuration.

41
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,949
And I do.

42
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,243
For the most part.

43
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,332
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

44
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,668
It's just that I--

45
00:04:53,877 --> 00:05:00,884
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

46
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,427
You see-- It's--

47
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,265
It's as if I'm classical...

48
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:13,063
...but you are more jazz.

49
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,775
-Jazz.
-Jazz. Yes.

50
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,778
And God knows

there is nothing wrong with jazz.

00:

It's simply that I require....

-Exactly.

53
05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,624
Oh, shit.

54
05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,794
Man, this is the bomb.

55
05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,011
What's up, partner?

56
05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,600
-I can't believe this.
-My replacement?

57

Oh, Jesus.

Hi. Gale.

59
05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,816
-Nice to meet you.
-What's up?

60

:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,569

we should've ditched that RV
months ago.

61
06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,321
all, like, shiny up in here.

62
06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,037

I must be missing something.

I don't mean-- I don't mean to be--

63
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,165
-This--
-No.

64
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,128
--makes no sense.

65
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:30,348
So I guess this is....

66
002063 32,350 ==> 00706: 36,187
Oh, dear mother of God.

67
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,525
This is for the best.

68
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,654
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

69
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,656
Yeah.
70
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,034
Oh, man.
71
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,995
Mr. White.
72

00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,092
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

73
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,511
Some new techniques to learn.

74
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,140
-What, now?
-Yes, now.

75
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,310
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

76
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,228
And I need to get you up to speed.

77
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,317
Right on. I'm just saying....

78
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,363
How's the cell service down here?

79
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,198
It's nonexistent.

80
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,824
We're shielded.

81
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,327
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

82
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,704
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

83
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,540
...other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

84
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,834
Why?

85
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42, 629
Your brother-in-law.

86
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,090
What about him?

87
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,553
-What's the story?
-He was unresponsive.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

88
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,889
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

89
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,141
-Two units of normal saline.
-Bivalve mass.

90
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,228
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

91
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,897
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

92
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,192
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

93
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,485
Where's that blood?

94
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,571
Dr. Bording to Cardiology.

95
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,157
Dr. Bording to Cardiology.

-Sir, can I help you?
-Yeah, I--

97
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,246
-It's all right. He's family.
-Thank you.

98
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,876
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

99

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,258
I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,011
I don't know what to say.

101
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,061
-How is he?
-I don't know.

102
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,148
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

03
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,152
They shot him four times.

04
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,113
Oh, Christ.
05

00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,995
-Where's Holly?
-I got a sitter.

 

06
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,584
-Hey, how are you, huh?
-Fine.

07
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,294
Yeah?

08
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
Sure?

09
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,843
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

10
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,221
Okay.

 

11
00#09:15,430 => 00:09:19, 851
-Here. Let me get the door.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-I got it. I'm fine.

112
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,193
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

113
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,320
-Hello.
-I'm very sorry.

14
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,821
Thank you.
15

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,366
Can you tell us anything?
Any details?

 

16
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,161
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

117
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,372
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

18
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,002
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with a drug cartel.

18
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,340
Why did they attack Hank?

20
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
We're not sure yet.

 

2a.
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,179
It could be in relation to an
investigation Hank was working...

122
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,892
...0or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
23
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,687
They had an axe.

24
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,109
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

 

25
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,111
Jesus.
26

 

 

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,033
-Where are they? I mean, did they--?
-Hank got both of them.

127
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,870
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

128
00%107321,079 ==> 00:10:24,791
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

129
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,627
...considering

he didn't even have his gun.

30
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,590
He didn't have his gun?

3.1,
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,889
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

32
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,725
Marie, the assault charge.

 

33:
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,728
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

 

 

134
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,857
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
135
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,567
You had to take it.

136
00%10:50,.775 ==> 00:10:53,570
-It's standard procedure. No one--
-Okay. All right, listen.

137
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,366
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

 

138
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,077
..-he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

139
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,913
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

140
OO: 204,122 --> 00: 206,457
-Marie, let's just--
-No. Just--
4l
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,336

t's their fault.

42
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,547
He didn't have a gun.

43
00: 212,755 --> 00: 214,757
Honey, this isn't helping you.

 

 

44

00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,634
You.
45

00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,804

What kind of partner are you?

 

46
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,642
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

Where were you?

Texas.
49
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,900
And you.
50
00:11:32,108 =-> 00:11:35,236

 

 

 

 

You're supposed
to protect your agents...

151
00: 235,445 --> 00: 237,447
-instead of taking their guns...
152
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,450

..not supporting them,
not backing them up.

153
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,118
-Marie. Marie.

Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

155
OO#1ll: 47,498 => 00s.112 51,961
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

-Sorry--
-Go.

It's not just them.

It's you, Walt.

 

63
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:39,342
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

 

 

164
00%12:39,550 ==> 00312: 42,470
...-Hank would have never
even heard his name...

165
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,349
...if you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

166
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,477
-Marie--
-Do you ever think about that, Walt?

167
002122 49,686 =-> 00:12:51,396
Do you?

168
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,691
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

169
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56, 943
Marie, stop.

170
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,196
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

It's not his fault.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Jesse Pinkman in the house.

Oh, my dear God.

184
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,329
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

185
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,124
Walter White,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

186
00816: 51,636 -—> 00:16: 53, 763
Yo, we working sometime this year?

187
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,559
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

188
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,354
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

189
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,023
-How am I to get a hold of you?

-You aren't.

190
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,068
It's been a whole day.

How long is this grieving process?

 

191,
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,945
Just put a clock on it for me.

192
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,948
All I'm saying
is we have a schedule, right?

193
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,742
My family
comes before your schedule.

194
00217:14,.951 =-> 00:17:16,911

-I'll get there when I get there.

196
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25, 628
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

197
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28, 631
-You will do no such thing.
-Why not?

198
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,425
Well, for starters...

199
00%17:31,634 =—> 00:17:34,595
...you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

200
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,306
There's gotta be some sort of manual,
right?

201
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,268
-And I can read.
-Jesse, touch nothing.

202
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42, 645
Stop treating me
like I'm like your assistant.

203
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46, 440
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

204
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:52,780
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

205
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,116
Thank you very much

Yes. Yes, she is.

208
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,083
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

209
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,918
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

210
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,129
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

211

...to head towards the light.

212
00#18212,883 ——> 00:18: 16,887
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

 

213
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,850
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

214
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,870
You know,

these eggs are really not too bad.

215
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,844
-Look at that.
-Look at what?

216
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,181
At what? This. These spots.

217
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,059

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

This fork is absolutely filthy.

218
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,650
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

21:9
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,153
Marie, those are just water spots.

220
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,404
That's fine.

221
00¢19215,738 =-> 00219: 18,032
Those are not "water spots."

222
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,201
It's dirt.

 

223
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,704
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

 

 

224
00219:23,913 =-> 00:19:27,541
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

225
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,002
God knows what.

22:6
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,006
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

227
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,218
Ours at home aren't any better.

228
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,262
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

229
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,599
They need to be a higher standard.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
They have a responsibility.

230
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,351
Well, I'm not actually sure...

23.1,
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,397
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

232
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,733
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

233
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,485
Do you think that sick people...

234
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,279
..-aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

235
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,700
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

236
00:20:03,327 =--> 00:20:05,246
Marie....

237
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,709
I survived.

238
00220310,960 ==> 00720:13,713
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

239
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,589
Remember that?

240
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18, 968
Remember how scared we all were?

241
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:24,807
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

242
00:20:25,766 -->
All that week,

243
00:20:28,436 -->

00:20:28,227

all I could think of...

00:20:33,023

...was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

244
00:20:33,232 -->
...and take out a

245
00:20:36,485 -->
-that was with me

246

00:20:39,822 -->
I couldn't get
out of my

247

00:20:44,160 -->

00:20:36,277
part of me...

00:20:39,613
my entire life.

00:20:42,116
that image
head.

00:20:50,958

I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

248
00220:51,375 =->

00:20:56,297

Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetize you.

249

00:20:56,672 -->

00:21:01,886

Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

250

00:21:08,058 -->

00:21:12,980

Actually what I really remember

about that

251
00:21:13,189 -->

day...

00:21:15,649

..-is driving to the hospital.

252
00:21:15,858 -->

Skyler,

00:21:18,694

you remember me

wanting to drive that day?

253
00:21:19,361 -->

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

00:21:20,988
Yeah.

254
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,992
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central...

255
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,329
...and we hit every green light.

256
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:33,709
I mean,
every single light that we hit...green.

257
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,213
It's just-- When does that happen?

258
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:43,844
Just like, bang, bang,
green the entire way.

259
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,140
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

260
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:53,687
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

261
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,024
...a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

262
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,405
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

263
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,743
At least I was with my family.

264
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,580
I had that.

265

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00222 416,252 ==> 00222: 21,090
Anyway, I survived this place.

266
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,261
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

267
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,372
Yes?

268
00%22:54,582 =-> 00:22:56,792
What the hell is going on up there?

269
OOS222 57,167 --> 00822359,003
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

270
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,671
You know about my men?

271
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,466
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?

272
00223304,675 ==> 00923208, 679
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

273
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,809
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

274
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,770
Someone gave the go-ahead.

275
002232 16,979 =< 002239919,.273
Are you accusing me?

276
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,984
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

277

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00223322,192 == 002235 25,324.
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

278
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,742
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

279
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,411
-Any thoughts on when it might arrive?
-A week, a month.

280
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,625
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

281
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,960
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

282
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41, 629
...from my man who survived.

283
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,632
Your man is in custody.

284
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45, 966
God bless America!

285
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,719
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

286
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50, 638
I'll get him the best lawyer...

287
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,848
...and then we'll learn the truth.

288
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,684
Well, keep me apprised.

289

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,774
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

290
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,276
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

291
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,237
...-but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

292
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,990
He's out of surgery, at least, which is--

293
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,494
-Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
-All right. And where's that?

294
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,663
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

295
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,040
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

 

296
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,834
How long will that take?

 

297
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,045
I can't really say. It could be hours.

298
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,548
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

299
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,843
Thank you.

300
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,644
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

301

302
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,565
I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,693
Me neither.

304
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,536
Well, is anyone else
dying to brush their teeth...

305
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,413
...or is it just me?

306
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,875
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

307
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,670
Marie? I could swing by your place.

308
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,048
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

309
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,427
Okay.

310

Walt. Walt.

311
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,738
We just heard he came through.

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,124
-Good to meet you. Hi.
-Hey.

316
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,878
-We were just swapping Hank stories.
-That could go on all day.

317
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,297
God knows,
there's a million of them.

318
00225749,965 ==> 00:25:53,427
-Meanwhile....
-Miserable piece of shit.

319
009253 53,677 => 00225:56,.138
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

320
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,141
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

321
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,976
Your tax dollars at work.

322
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,645
You ought to see what Hank did
to that bastard.

323
00226: 05,272 ==> 00226206, 857
Wanna see?

324
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,651

-You got him?
-Come on.

327

-All right.
-Easy now, easy.

328
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,272
Come here.

329
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,068
No.

330
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,781
Oh, shit.

331
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,499
Yeah.

 

332
002293 21,969 == 00929224,721
Finally. About damn time.

333
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,653
Why isn't there anything cooking?

334
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58, 880
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

335
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,342
-Operator.
-This is Walter White.

336
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,261
I'll connect you.

337
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,350

Yo, we got problems, big ones.

338
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,229
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

339
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,814
Turn your phone on already.

340
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,026
You know,

I will definitely look into that.

341
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,071
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

342
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,740
Okay?

343
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:30,078
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

344
002303 30,287 ==> 009380232, 205
Yeah, dick, I was waiting...

345
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,167
...and then that creepy, quiet guy
showed up.

346
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,045
-Gus came by?
-Not him, man.

347
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,547
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

348
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,383
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
349
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,093
He started asking questions too.

350
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:49,264
Like why haven't we cooked anything.
All right, we have a quota.

351
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,060
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

352
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,104
Because that guy,
he's got, like, the dead eyes.

353
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,564
Let me ask you something.

354
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,484
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

355)
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,904
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

356
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,865

Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.

Why?

357
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,534
No. He kept-- He kept saying...

358

00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,372

.that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

 

 

359
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,083
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

360
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,629

What the hell has this got to do with--?
Look, I don't know. It was....

361
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,425
His cousins.

362
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,887
Right, Jesse? It was--
It was his cousins.

363
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,598
Yeah, cousins.

364
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,350
Whatever, man. Why?

365,
00231:52,369 => 00231: 53,912
Any news?

366
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,956
No change.

Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

 

368
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,967
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.

369
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,469
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

370
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,179
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

371
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,307
Yeah.

372

-Do you wanna come?
-Yeah.

Nurse Franklin,
please page the operator.

Nurse Franklin, page the operator.

-Yeah.
-Yeah?

-Looks interesting.
-Yeah.

 

382
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,857
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

383
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,030
Well, what's it about?

384
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,537
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

385
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,707
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

386
00233:22,417 =-> 00:33:25,921
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

387
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,548
..-and tried to bring him down.

388
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,760
Some of them were DEA, you know?

389
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:37,098
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

390
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,352
...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

391
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,272
-but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

392
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,360
I guess I never thought about it.

393
00%33451,863 ==> 003333 58,453
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

394
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,464
So he gave it to me.

395
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,300
Figured I'd read it.

396
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,233
I need to--
397
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,402
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Okay.

398
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,621
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

399
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,458
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow
as scheduled.

400
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,669
Well--

401
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,130
Unfortunately....

402
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,007
Unfortunately...

403
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,344
...we're not going to be able
to keep our schedule this week.

404
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,763
But not for lack of trying.

405
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,974
Is there something I should know?

406
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,020
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

407
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,315
...-Gale really screwed us up.

408
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,485
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just-- He set us way back.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

409
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,488
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

410
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,994
And I've had to be out
running errands...

411
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,538
-and trying to keep us on target.

412
00%35425,332 s=> 002358 28,001
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly--

413
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,171
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

414
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,466
But rest assured that--

415
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,968
That we will do whatever it takes.

416
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,346
It has my total attention.

 

417
00235: 39,554 => 00:35: 41,765
We'll cook through the weekend
if necessary.

418
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,978
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

419
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,192
I have your word on that?

420

Yeah. Right.

No, I'm just wandering.

425
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:37,404
-How's everybody doing?
-Well, as well as can be expected.

426
00236: 37,612 => 00:36: 40, 615
It's this not knowing...

427
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,284
...-that's the hardest part, I think.

428
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,080
Anything new on these guys?

429
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,249
Who they are? What they wanted?

a 10,000-dollar reward...

You know, I didn't say thank you.

482
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,489
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

483
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,078
Good to see you.
Enjoy the chicken?

484
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,915
-Good. Good.
-Excuse me.

485
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20, 460
My pleasure. My pleasure.

486
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,211
Thank you. Thank you.

487
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,255
-It's good chicken, huh? Good.
-Yeah.

488
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,591
-Mr. Fring.
-Mr. White.

489
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,094
-I just wanted to thank you again.
-It's my pleasure.

490
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,390
May I--? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

491
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,480
You knew.

492
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,317
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

493
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,695
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

494
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,490
What careful man wouldn't?

495
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,620
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

496
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,834
Your being here is--

497
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,296
Is this some sort of message?

498
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,799
I'm supporting my community.

499
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,718

I hide in plain sight, same as you.

500
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,637

-Are we done?
-No, listen, I--

501
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,224

 

 

 

This attack on my brother-in-law,

I don't understand it.

502
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,351
I don't know what it means.

503
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,605

Please,
if you have some knowledge...

 

504
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,024

 

-that you could share with me....

505
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,864
I fear for my family.

506
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,449
I'm sure they'll be fine.

507
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,328
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

508
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,706
It's doubtful he'll live.

509
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,878
Now thank me and shake my hand.

510
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:54,220
-Thank you. Thank you again.
-You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

511
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,558
Did you hear that?

 

512
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,897
-We're going up?
-Come on.

513
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,025
What's going on?

514
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,569
What's happening?

515
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,406
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

516
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,366
-One, two, three--
-Defib?

Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

518
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,538
One, two, three, four.

5.19
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,124
-Give me a liter of saline.
-I can't get a pulse.

520
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,834
One, two, three, four.

621
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,212
-Still nothing.
-All right, stopping compressions.

522
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,673
-Time?
-Eight forty-three.

523
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,925
Time of death, 20:43.

524

Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

525
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,750
Yes? Juan?

526
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07, 627
I assume you heard the news.

527
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10, 463
Your man died. I heard.

528
002438:10,671 =-> 00743213,257
-It's unfortunate.
-Yeah, unfortunate.

529
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,260
And meanwhile, I have Federales

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

surrounding my house.

530
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:20,181
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

531
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,600
Why would I do this?

532
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,978
-How would it serve me?
-That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

533
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,356
Go off on your own, maybe.

534
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,483
Would you actually think
that would work?

535
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,444
Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.

536
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,614
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

537
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,407
I see things clear enough.

538
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,120
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

53.9
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,455
D.F. suddenly has to put
on a big show...

540
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,375
...and I wind up with Federales
in my rosebushes.

00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,293
But just for a while.

542
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,506
Appearances, politics.

543
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,633
Are you still there, Gustavo?

544
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,510
Yes.

545
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:58,970
I'm here.

546
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,639

I'll weather this. I always do.

547
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,307
My brother's a police chief.

548
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,144
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

549
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,479
And when I get proof...

550
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,524
...and the others find out
what you've done...

551
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,694

..Maybe we come pay you a visit.

552
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,737
Maybe we can--

553)
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:08,581
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.
554
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,500
Oh, how is he?

Tell me something good.

555
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:15,046
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

556
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,673
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

557
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,842
-We're all family.

-I understand.

558
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,012
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need--

559
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25, 681

We're all family.

00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:06,590
In the little village where I was born,
life moved at a slower pace...

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,594
...yet felt all the richer for it.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:16,767
There, my two uncles were known far
and wide for their delicious cooking.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18, 936
They seasoned their zesty chicken...

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22, 606
...using only the freshest herbs
and spices.

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,068
People called them
Los Pollos Hermanos...

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,861
..."The Chicken Brothers."

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,781
Today, we carry on their tradition...

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,992
...in a manner that would make
my uncles proud.

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,955
The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care...

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,583
...then slow-cooked to perfection.

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:47,089
Yes, the old ways are still best
at Los Pollos Hermanos.

Whatever.

We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,597
We ship it as is.

21
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,851
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,793
-Why can't you just appreciate that?
-Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,295
-Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
-Yeah.

29
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,965
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

30
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,175
...that this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,886
-We both earn--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,223
A million and a half each.

33
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,394
What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,565
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

35
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,316
That's probably high.

36
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56, 987

All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,951
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,997
And, like, what happens at the end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,168
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,336
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is--

42
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,590
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,176
Ninety-six million dollars.

44

Ninety-six million dollars.

45
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,682
All right? Ninety-six million.

46
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,685
Ninety-six to our three.

47
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,687

00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,071
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

81
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,074
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

82
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:53,955
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

83
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,749
Even right here in town.

84
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,294
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

85
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,087
Man, it's crazy.

00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,175
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,260
Because you were right.

88
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,596
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

89
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,222
Well, three cheers for me.

90
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,145
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

al
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19, 689
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

92
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,399
It's been an hour, right?

93
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,028
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

94
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27, 864
I'll go find somebody.

95
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,785
Hey, no more shop talk.

96
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,578
Sorry.

97
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,043
I didn't see it coming.

98
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43, 338
What? Damn right, you did.
99
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,715
No, I didn't see shit.

00
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,260
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

01
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56, 643
The only reason I'm even breathing...

02
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,605
.-is I got a warning call.

03
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,943
A warning call? What do you mean?

 

04
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,572
One minute
before they attacked me...

105
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,910
...somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

106
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,455
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

107
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,419
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

108
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,548
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

109
00208326, 756 ==> 00708: 29,175
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

110
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,138
-Who would have called to warn you?
-I don't know.

One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

125
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,269
Been working a lot.

126
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,605
-Got a job.
-Job is good.

27

00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,651
It's in a Laundromat.

t's totally corporate.

28
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52, 986
Corporate Laundromat.

 

29
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,614

It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.

My boss is a dick.

130

The owner, super dick.

I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

132
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,832
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

 

 

133
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,170
...the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so....

134
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,173

You've got all these nice tulips

and baby's breath.

141

Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

-Yeah.
-Look at these, Hank.

-Aren't they beautiful?
-Beautiful.

144

Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

145
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,918
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

146
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,711

You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

"Get well and best wishes

-I know. He's great.

here from Kleinman.

a quick peripheral response, all right?

All right, let's just take a look here.

160

All right.

00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,469
All right, now I want you to tell me

if you can feel this.

 

 

62
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,600
All right.
63

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,811
How about this?

64
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,482
Okay.

65
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,610
How about now?

66
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,613
Do that one again, would you?

67
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,907
Right there?

68

-Yeah, yeah, feel a tingle.

-Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,749

So this is good news, right?

Oh, yeah, definitely.
81
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,037
Gosh.

It looks like some nerve function
is returning.

183

00213:52,999 --> 00:13:54,833
Oh, thank God.

184
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,713
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

185
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:09,390
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

186
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,018
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,313
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

188
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,523
But you can't know for sure.

189
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,360
-No.
-When does he start physical therapy?

 

190
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,695
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

191.
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26, 866
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorization in the next few days.

92
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,701
Certainly by early next week.

93
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,370
Next week?

 

94
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,955
No, that's not gonna do it.

 

 

95

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,582
I've looked into this.

196
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,544
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

197
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:42,006
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

198
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,257
-Well--
-Actually...

199
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,552
-your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

200
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,765
Actually, she asked the doctor.

201
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:56,229
Plan-wise, four treatments a week

is fairly typical.

202
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,482
And the therapists in your network

are mostly fine.

 

 

203
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,443
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

204
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:10,326
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

205
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,246
..--wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

206
00215:15,123 =-> 00:15:18,251

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

It's very hard to say, Marie.

207
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,755
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

208
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,216
Is it absolutely optimal?

209
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,344
You know, screw it.

210
00215329,095 ==> 00215: 32,014
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

211
002153 32,223 =-> 00:15:35,393
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

212
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,772
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

213
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,941
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

214
00%15:42,150 ==> 00:15:45,778
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

215
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48, 448
...occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

216
00%15748,656 ==> 0031.5: 51, 951
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

217
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,744
So what?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
218
00215253,953 --> 00315: 56,247
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

219
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59, 667
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

220
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,461
...they may never pay you back.

22.1,
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,840
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

222
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,177
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

223
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,471
I can give you some names.

224
O0#816:311,679 => 00:16: 13,806
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

225
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,308
To hell with the plan.

226
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,289
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

227
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,501
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

What am I doing here?

Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

today's your lucky day.

...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

245

Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

00217 $345 762 ==— 00217238,.391
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

247
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,063
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

248
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,526
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

249
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,529
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

Humor me here for a second.

252
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,747
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

253
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,751
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

254
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,879
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

255
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,715
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

256
002183 10,923 ==— 00218s 13,301
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

257
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,095
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

258
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,764
£ they can get Capone,
they can get you.

259

00218318,973 == 0018s 23,227
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

260
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,104
Okay, here's your cash.

261
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,274
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

 

 

262
00218:28,482 =-> 00:18: 32,236
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

263
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,072
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
264
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,616
Now, what does he see?

265
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,452
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

266
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,288
...unlimited cash supply and no job.

267
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,791
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

268
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,086
-I'm a drug dealer.
-Wrong.

269
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52, 632
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

270
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,134
What do they do?
They take every penny...

271
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,554
...and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

272
002193 00,1389 ==> 00219% 01,307
What was your mistake?

273
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,934
You didn't launder your money.

274
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,730
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

 

 

275
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,816
Hand me that little thing-- Bin.

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,111
This is the nail salon, right?

277
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,242
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

278
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,161
That's called layering.

inal step, integration.

Ry

280
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,667
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

281
002195 27,875 == 002198 30,878
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

 

 

282
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,756
..into nice, clean, taxable income...

283
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:38,052
...-brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

284
002197 39,512 ==> 002919%43,516
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

285
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,184
I'm a criminal, yo.

286
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:50,856
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

287
OOSL9: 51,065 +> 00119753, 651

and listen to your lawyer.

288
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,904
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

289
008194 57,113 29> 002198 59,156
No, that's 17 percent.

290
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,535
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

291
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,038
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

292
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,875
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

293
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,877
Hey, what? You-- Hey, listen--

294
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,049
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

295
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,134
How is your brother-in-law?

296
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,305
He'll live.

297
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,768
Good. I'm glad.

298
00221 311,145 == 002213 13,981
Walter, you seem troubled.

299
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,150
How can I help you?

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
300
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,658
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

301
O0#21226,160 —— > 003212 33,0414
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

302
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:40,841
...and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

303
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,429
That's the best way to do business.

304
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,811
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

305
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,522
...someone called to warn him.

306
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,194
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

307
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,366
Those two men, the assassins...

308
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,744
...I believe I was their prime target.

309
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:14,542
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

310
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,882
Because of this intervention...

311
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,552
..-I am alive.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
312
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,723
And yet I think that this person...

313
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,269
..was playing a much deeper game.

314
00$22235,563 --> 00722: 39,024
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

315
00#22:39,233 => 00:22: 42,194
..not a silent assassination.

316
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,241
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

317
00222347, 575 ==> 00:22:52,788
...set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

318
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,375
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

319
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,759
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

320
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,265
..-he would have the market
to himself.

321
009233 13,267 => 00223: 18,522
The rewards would be enormous.

322
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,907
We're both adults.

323
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,286
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
324
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,085
I want there to be no confusion.

325
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,465
I know I owe you my life.

326
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,472
And more than that...

B27
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,184
...I respect the strategy.

328
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,437
In your position...

32.9
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,067
...I would have done the same.

330
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,286
One issue which troubles me...

33.
00#24:16,622 => 00:24:21,835
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

332
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,714
What would you like to happen?

333
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29, 802
You know why I do this.

334
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,681
I want security for my family.

335
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,182
Then you have it.

336
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,978
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

337
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,357
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

338

Cald it 15.
339
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,988
Open-ended.
340

00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,156
Would that be agreeable?

341
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,806
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

342
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,852
...is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

343
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,898
...head off our disease before
it comes back.

344
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,069
so, anyone?

345
00726:53,821 --> 00:26:57,533
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

346
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,205
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

347
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,417
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

348
002272 07,625 <> 00327: 09,253
...what would you do?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
349
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,214
Make more green, man. A lot more.

350
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,467
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

351
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,850
I don't know.

352
00:27:23,433 =-> 00:27:27,771
I guess I would make something.

353
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,857
Like what?

354
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,445
I don't know if it even matters...

355
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,533
...but work with my hands, I guess.

356
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:45,414
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

357
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:51,086
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

358
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,966
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

359
00:27:56,175 --> 00:28:00,929
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

360
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,975
-Mr. Pike.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
3161
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,105
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

362
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,481
He was hard of hearing.

363
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:15,944
My project for his class...

364
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,073
..was to make this wooden box.

365
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:24,119
You know, like a small--

366
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,874
Just like a--
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

367
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,836
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

368
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,089
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

369
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:41,803
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

370
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,848
So I finished it in a couple days.

371
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,269
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

372
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,689
.»..you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
373
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,819
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

374
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,239
...for my grade...

375
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,202
..-he looked at it and said:

376
00#29:05,702 => 00:29:08,872
"Is that the best you can do?"

377
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,959
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

378
00229:312,167 ==> 00:29:17,881
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

379
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,764
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but....

380
00:29:27,015 =-> 00:29:29,309
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

381
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:34,898
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

382
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,569
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

383
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44, 866
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

384
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,036

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I made another, then another.

385
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,124
And by the end of the semester,
by like box number five...

386
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,127
..-I had built this thing.

387
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,257
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

388
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,388
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

389
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,223
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

390
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:12,519
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

39.1
00230312, 769 ==> 007303 18,567
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

392
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,319
It even smelled good.

393
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,781
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was--

394
00230228,41.0 => 00:30: 30,037
It was perfect.

395
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,456
What happened to the box?

396
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,296

It's never too late.

00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,309

You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

409
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,094
Well, you two managed, right?

410
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,428
You said yourself...

411
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,015
-that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

412
00231233,725 --> 00:31:37,479
-Jesus, I gotta get back.
-What? No.

413
00231:37,687 => 00:31:39,064
No, no, no, you should rest.

414
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,192
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

 

415
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,071
-I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
-I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

416
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,324
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

417

-Hey, Sky.
-Hey.

418
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,166
-What are you doing here?
-Thought I'd stop by...

419

Is this a bad time?

Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

Oh, you're Ted.

423

I've heard so much about you.

424

Thank you for your gift basket.

425
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,517
-That was really thoughtful.
-It was nice. Thank you.

You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

Are you coming in?

Would you like a glass?

No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

I just thought I'd--

You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

436

It was nice to meet you, Ted,

for a visit, so....

441

-Okay?

453

Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

You're divorced. So what?

455
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,037

okay?

456
00233359,246 ==> 00734: 02,123
-Is there some reason for secrecy?
-Later. Not now.

457
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,585
-Skyler, just tell me--
-You really wanna do this now?

458
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,255
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

459
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16, 346
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,057
Bad idea to come here.

461

Ted, I'm--

462
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26, 690
I'll see you in a day or two.

463
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,067
Back at the office.

464
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,696
Take as much time as you want.

465
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,540
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

466

Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

No quotas, no one to answer to.

What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

002357 03,393 s=> 002358 07,272
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

True that. Two of them bitches.

Just saying. Devil's advocate.

475
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,950
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

-Church.

We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

Ain't top-shelf,

482

Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

483
00235:50,273 --> 00:35:52,317
And who says we sell on the street?

484
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,819
Maybe I know a whole new market.

485
00235: 55,028 => 00:35:58,114
Maybe all we need is the meth.

486
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,693
What's the yield?

Hey.

488
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,032
The yield. Come on.

Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us

something about yourself?

496

-it's just one thing.

498

It's meth.

It's bad.

500
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,096

you know.

501
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,391
But then, Jesus...

502
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,645
...this new version of it
hit the streets...

503
00237:53,438 => 00:37:56,816
-...and, wow.

I had it kicked a couple times,
-Not that blue stuff.

504
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,903
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

No, go ahead. This

the blue stuff.

Yeah, exactly,

-You had it too?
-Yeah, bro.

508
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,914
I wish I never even heard of it.

509

Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

p14.
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,925
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

That's the shame of it.
513
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,763
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.
514

00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,973

I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

518

Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.

Walt.

529
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,721
We can always pay their bills.

530
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,475
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

53.1
00239: 54,684 => 00:39:58,521
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

532
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,774
-Skyler.
-I think Marie should know the truth.

533
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,904
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

534
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08, 948
-I think that--
-He earned it gambling.

535
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15, 413
Walt andl...

536
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,958
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

537
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:26,716
And what it all came down to really...

538
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29, 928
..was money.

539
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,430
Pure and simple.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
540
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,224
When Walt was diagnosed...

541
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,978
..it changed him.

542
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,441
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

543
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,110
.-what it was
that he was going through.

544
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,905
It was more than facing death.

545
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,325
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

546
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,162
«ttothing.

547
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,626
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

548
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,295
...he wanted to provide.

549
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:11,761
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

550
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,808
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

551
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,060
Yeah, I thought so too.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

552
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,563
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

Isn't that right?

555)
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,787
So he put his mind to it and....

556
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,002
Well, you know how Walt is.

557
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,170
He's a problem-solver.

558
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:51,300
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

 

 

559
00241:51,509 ==> 00244: 56,305
-and he came up with this system.

560
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,391
A system?

561
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,645
A system for counting cards
in blackjack.

562
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,107
What do you mean, like Rain Man?

563
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,862

you know, all the details...

564

God, what is it?

00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,247
A statistical edge?

567
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,626
Yes, statistical--

568
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,545

569
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:32,341
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

570
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,763
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realized that--

S71
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:44,771
But then he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

572
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,523
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

573
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,861
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

574
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,449
Like an illegal backroom game.

575
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,871
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
576
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,375
...all that time he used to spend
away from home?

577
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,422
I guess for a couple months there...

578
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,884
...you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

579
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,556
Oh, my God.

580
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,894
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

581
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,064
-Was that some sort of cover?
“Noy Hos

582
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,483
He did not fake that, Marie.

583
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,319
The night that Walt disappeared...

584
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,368
..-he lost $14,000.

585
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,832
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

586
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,379
..-basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

587
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,674
He couldn't live with it.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
588
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,801
He was suicidal.

589
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:01,848
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital.

590
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:07,770
..-he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

591
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:13,025
How could you do that to her, Walt?

592
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:17,196
Anyway, this system of his?

593
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,534
He finally got it to work.

594
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,956
So all this is to say
we have the money.

595:
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,168
No more gambling.

596
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,005
But we have the money.

597
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:40,303
How much money?

598
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,346
Walt?

599
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,853
Well...

600
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,985
..it's into seven figures.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

601
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,406
Holy Mary, mother of God.

602
002452: 01,282 => 00:45:03,114
What can I say?

603
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,370
I did very well.

604
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,248
Marie...

605
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,710
..-you will take our money.

606
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:18,090
Use it to take care of Hank.

607
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,762
Please. Marie, let us help.

608
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:28,059
-Does Walt, Jr. know about this?
-Absolutely not.

609
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,311
And I need to keep it that way.

610
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,231
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

611
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,984
-Can we please keep this between us?
-Yeah. Yeah, I--

612
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,071
Yeah, I just-- I need to--

613
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,449

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

614
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,161
How did you come up with that?

615
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,082
I mean, where did you possibly--?

616
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,127
I learned from the best.

617
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,843
Somehow...

618
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:08,266
...something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

 

619
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:13,104
And I'm not forgetting that.

i
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,833
Surprised he doesn't
make us do that.

2
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,796
The pack totally has a pecking order.

3
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,717
And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

4
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,386
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

5
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,722
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

6
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,059
They have to lick his junk.

7
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,729
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

8
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:33,820
Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all...

9
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,825
...we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

10
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,373
And water boys, you know?

de
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,251
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

12
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,089
Get us a couple flunkies in here.
13
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,216
Treat us right.

14
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,689
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

15
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,190
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

16
00:03:11,358 =-> 00:03:14,069
-I don't understand.
-What?

17
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,363
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

18
00203316,530 ==-> 00:03:18,782
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

19
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,618
No, it's not that.

 

20
00203321, 785 === 00303: 26,623
It's our output. We're off.
We're .14 percent off.

21
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,086
Point one-four. That's, what, like--?

22
003034 31,253 =->. 00:03% 32,713
What does that mean?

23
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,591
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

24
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,388
So how far off are we?

25

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,974
It's not negligible.

26
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:50,605
Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

27
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,568
That's weird.

28
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,653
Well, what about spillage?

29
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,905
Spillage?

30
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,241
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

31
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,326
Nothing gets spilled.

32
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,786
A little maybe.

33
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,580
Nothing gets spilled.

34
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,040
What about evaporation?

35
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,503
It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

36
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,505
What about the other one?

37
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,508
The drops, like on--

-Yeah.

40

No.

41

about the crap
left behind?

what

42
--> 00:04:32,355

know, all the gunk

we scrape out of the vats.

43

00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,859

Gotta add

up to like a gallon each.

44

00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,278
Did you work that in?

45

00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:43,366

-Vestiges.

-Yeah. Vestiges.

46

00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,121

Bet that's it.

47

00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50, 665

Bet

that's totally it.

48
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,713
Hey, Mr. White.

That's great.

Shut the door!

-My ears are popping.
-Shut the door. Move.

What the hell's doing that?

God, it frigging kills, yo.

-I am moving it around.

of contaminant.

88
like,

89

are we dealing with here?

mean, a fly. A housefly.

Singular?

-It got into the lab.

102
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,454
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

03
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:33,002

No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

04
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,673
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

 

05
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,841
When you say it's contamination,
I mean...

106
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,302
-I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

107
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,553
Ebola.

108
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,306
Yeah, it's a disease

on The Discovery Channel...

109
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,559
..-where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

 

 

110
00%12:48,726 ==> 00:12:51,229.
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,234
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

112
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:03,908
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

113
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,370

Jesse, listen.

114
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,749
This fly--
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

15
002133 11,916 ==> 00213: 14,043
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

116
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,588
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

117
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:23,761
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated...

18
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,347
..we need to take this very seriously.

19
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,224
Now do you understand?

20
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,521
So is that your fly-saber?

21
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,400
This is a swatter.

22
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,278
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

 

 

23
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,781
Hey, what happened to your head?

24
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,450
Nothing. I'm fine.

 

25
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,619
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
126
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:53,124
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

127
00%13254,292 ==> 00:14: 00,923
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

128
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,761
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

129
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,473
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

130
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,935
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

31
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,815
...any pollutant...

32
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,819
..no matter how small...

33
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,742
scould completely. .....

34
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,757
Hello?

35
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,636
What?

 

36
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,850
Were you here all night?

 

37
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,769
Have you even slept?

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
138
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,480
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,941
Will you just please focus on--?

140
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,990
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

141
00215: 08,157 => 00:15: 10,284
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

42
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,204
Fricking finally.

43
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,669
What are you doing?

44
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,879
It's time to alkaline.

45
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,216
Have you not heard a word I said?

46
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,678
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

 

 

47
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,139
Have I been speaking to myself?

48
00:15:31,305 =-> 00:15:33,558
The timer went off, yo.

 

49
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,894
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

150
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,898

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

151
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,067
"Clear the contaminant."

152
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,862
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

153)
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,699
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

 

154
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,033
What fly? All right?

155
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,912
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

156
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,416
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

 

 

157
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,377
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

158
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,339
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch...

159
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,758
...to the open air and contamination,
period.

160
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,429
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

161
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,764
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

62
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,559
So I need your answer right now.

63
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,942
Okay.

64
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,956
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

 

 

65
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,258
Look, like making cherry product,

but let's keep it real, all right?

166

00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,596
We make poison for people

who don't care.

167
00216353, 763 == 00216: 56,557
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

 

168
00816356, 124 -—> 00:16: 59,310
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

169
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,605
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

70
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:20,289
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds...

71
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,626
...that can go into candy bars?

72
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,129
That's the government, Jack.

 

73
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:33,928
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

175

Pig lips and assholes.

176
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:50,695
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

177

-And, you know, see what I'm try--?
-What are you doing?

178

Oh, hey.

179
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,206
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

180
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,001
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,

shut the lid.

 

 

181
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,712
No harm done. Then we're golden.

182
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,052
It stays closed. That's an order.

183
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:21,559

You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

184
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,942
God, what is your problem?

--> 00:20:54,044

will ruin our batch.

And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

225
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,219
Failing that...

is a serious thing now.

Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

257
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,869
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

258

What the hell is all this?

259
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,376

all right? I got a butt-load.

262
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,969
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

263
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,893
I sure hope we have enough.

264

I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say yeah.

How long do you think
you've been awake?

Why do you keep asking me that?

268

some coffee, is all. I know I could.

Yeah.

00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,756
Thank you.

277
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:55,804
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

278
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,478
Not that I can recall, no.

279
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,816
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house...

280
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,111
...-back before she died of cancer.

281
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:16,450
It was a possum.
Big freaky-looking bitch.

282
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,620
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

283
00226:19,787 ==> 00:26:23,832
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

284
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,503
You know, “opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

285
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,256
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

286
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,842
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

287
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,971
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

288
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:43,018
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

289
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,107
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped...

290
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,444
..-but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

291
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,781
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room...

292
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,992
...always scurrying around.

293
00226:59,159 ==— 002273 04,373
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

294
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,960
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

295
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,004
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

296
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,675

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

297
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,511
It's just so lame.

298
002272175678 ==> 00227: 22,015
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

299
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:28,147
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

300
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,526
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

301
00227732,693 ==> 003273 39,324
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

302
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:44,163
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

303
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,501
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

304
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,504
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

305
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,842
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

306
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,095
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

307
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,598

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Even gave it a name.

308
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,560
It was Scrabble.

309
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,020
Yeah, that was it.

310
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,940
You know,

"Scrabble, just knock it off."

311
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,447
She got like that toward the end.

312
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:26,038
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

313
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,706
We didn't know what was up.

314
00728:29,291 --> 00:28:33, 629
It wasn't like her to be that way.

 

315
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,221
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain...

316
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
...and that was why.

317
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,478
It metastasized.

318
00%28751,230 ==> 00328157, 277
But it was good that that was when

we decided to take her to the doctor...

319
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,780
...because then we knew
what was up.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

320
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,824
You know, got her some treatment.

B22.
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06, 828
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

322
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14, 336
It was a lot better after that.

323
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,257
You know, she was a lot happier.

324
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,016
Where the hell is he?

325
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,028

I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...

326
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,030
..-jJust last week.

327
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,785
I'm still in remission.

328
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,538
I'm healthy.

00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54, 626
Okay, so good. Great.

330
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,754
Well...

331
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,133
.-no end in sight.

332
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04, 386
That's great.

00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,348
Well...

334
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,976
...I missed it.

335
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:23,405
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

336
00#30225,198 => 00:30: 29,911
I had to have enough to leave them.

337
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,414
That was the whole point.

338
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,917
I mean, none of this--

339
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:40,881
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have enough.

340
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,595
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

341
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,264
It had to be before that.

342
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:54,102
Perfect moment for what?

343
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,439
To drop dead?

344
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,901
What, you saying you wanna die?

345
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:08,116
I'm saying I've lived too long.

349
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,967
But she just won't--

350
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,137
She just won't understand.

351
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:34,059
I mean, no matter how well
I explain it...

35.2
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,270
.these days, she just has this--

353
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,980
This--

354
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:46,279
I mean, I truly believe there exists
some combination of words.

355
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:52,160
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order. ...

Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

359
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,174
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state...

360
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,678
...but before the fugue state,
I didn't have enough money.

3161
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,348
So no, not then.

362
00232:21,.356 =-> 00:32:25,527
And plus,

my daughter wasn't born yet.

363
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,989
It had to be after Holly was born.

364
00#32:29,156 => 00:32: 30,824
Mr. White--
365

00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,785
Definitely before the surgery.

366
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,706
Oh, Christ.

367
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,208
That damn second cell phone.

368
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42, 961
I mean, how could I possibly...?

369
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,891
I know the moment.

370

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,856
It was the night Jane died.

371
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,238
Yeah, I--

372
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:16,495
I was at home
and we needed diapers...

373
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:21,416
...and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

374
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:26,046
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

375
00%33426,213 ==> 003333 29,257
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:33,512
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

377
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:38,934
t was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

378
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,771
I just walked in, sat down.

379
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,361
I never told you.

380
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,280
That you went to a bar?

 

381
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,783
No, I....

382
002332 56,785 <-> 00:34: 01,957
I sit down and this man,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

this stranger...

383
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,417
..he engages me in conversation.

384
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,586
He's a complete stranger.

385
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:15,303
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

386
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,305
What are you talking about?

387
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,141
Of course, I didn't know it
at the time.

388
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,270
I mean, he was just some guy
in a bar.

389
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,649
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

390
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,818
Jane's dad.

391
00234 429,985 ==> 00234232, 821
I mean, think of the odds.

392
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,659
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

393)
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:42,581
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down...

394
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46, 918
...that night in that bar
next to that man.

895
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,590
What did you talk about?

396
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,805
Water on Mars.

397
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,852
Family.

398
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,982
What about family?

399
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:16,990
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

400
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19, 367
Then he said:

401
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,953
"Never give up on family."

402
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,708
And I didn't.

403
00235:29,502 =--> 00:35:31,838
I took his advice.

404
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,189
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

405
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,400
It's simple chaos.

406
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57, 364
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies...

410
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:17,050
..-it's me who's having a drink
with him?

411
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,430

I mean, how can that be random?
412

00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,433

Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.
413

00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,895

No, no. No, it's--

414

002363315773 ==> 00736: 34,901

No. No.

415

00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,451
No, that was the moment.

416
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,788
That night.

417

00:36:49,791

I should never

00:37:02,470

--> 00:36:52,627

I was at home watching TV.

422
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,490
It was some--

423
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:28,121
Some nature program
about elephants.

424
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,501
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

a25
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,340
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

426
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,346
She was singing a lullaby.

427
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:58,526
If I had just lived right up
to that moment...

428
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,863
...and not one second more...

429
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,045

...that would have been perfect.

430
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,268
He's not coming down.

431
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,647
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

432
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37, 982
That's why he likes it.

433
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,778
Thailand's hot, right?

434
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,489
Yeah.

435
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,367
Then that's why.

436
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,747
-Oh, Jesus.

-Hey, hey, wait. Here.

437
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,514
He's not coming down.

438
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,893
He's staying up there forever.

439
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,337
What are you--? What are you doing?

440
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,174

I'm gonna get that bitch.

No, seriously, you're--
This is a bad idea.

444
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,151

Damn it.

00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,903
Jesse.

446
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,237
Just hold onto it.

447
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,656
Hold it still?

448
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,213
Jesse.

449
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,261
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,349
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

451
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,271
I'm sorry about Jane.

452
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,279
Yeah.

453
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,115
Me too.

454
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,869
mean...

 

455
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,960
...I'm very sorry.

456
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,008
It's not your fault.

457
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,804
It's not mine either.

458
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:17,266
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

459
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,407
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

460
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:38,079
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

461
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,084
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

462
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,837
But I miss her, though.

463
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,051
God, I do.

464
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,185
Jesse.

465
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,646
Come down.

466
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,191
Wait. I'm so close.

467
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,821
Let it go.

468
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,198
We need to cook.

469
00242:15,033 => 00:422 17,118
What about the contamination?

470
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,289
It's all contaminated.

471

00:

All right, well...

472
42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,841
-I definitely scared him.

473
42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,678

Probably stay out of our way.

00:

00:

00:

474
43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,669
Yeah!

475
43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,339
Somebody got got, yo!

476
43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,674

Did you see that, Mr. Wh--?

00:

00%

00%

00:

477
44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,807
Bins are packed?

478
44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,476
Bins are packed.

479
44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,645
How's the yield?

480
44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,231
Two-oh-two and change.

481
44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,817
You okay getting home?

482

:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,487

Yeah. Better. Thanks.

483
44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,573
Mafiana, then.

 

484
44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,174
Jesse, come here.
485
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,429
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

486
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,349
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

487
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,480
That half a pound
I said we were off by.

488
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:55,234
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if....

489
00:44:56,027 --> 00:45:00,281
You understand?
And if they ever found out....

490
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,536
I didn't take shit.

491
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,128
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,757
Who's asking you to?

Hi
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,389
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
002008 Lay 126 =<“ 00:00021,.563
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:28,403
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,908
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37, 996
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,708
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:47,339
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50, 342
It's who she was.

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,596
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

0
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,723
This chick have medical issues?

1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,143
This particular painting...

2
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,229
...is of a door.

 

3
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,109

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,112
Like, real ones or...?
15

00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,658
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,786
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

17
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,290
...over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,043
-But it wasn't the same.
-Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,921
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,674
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,427
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,597
And that's not psycho to you?

23)
00801: 36,763 => 00:01:39,891
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,603
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
25
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,356
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
O0#01:46,523 => 00:01:50,277
-Whoa, no.
-Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,572
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:54,031 +-> 00:01:57,367
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,953
Okay, fine.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,834
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,881
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,427
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

33
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,888
-and you might not even get why.

34
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,599
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

35
00202 %20,5 766 ==> 00302: 23,393
-wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,273
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,362
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

38
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,280
...until it was perfect.

39
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,699
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,119
Yeah? Well...

41
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,664
...I mean...

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,291
...some things.

43
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,226
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,271
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,818
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

46
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,238
..-until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:20,450
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,579
To me,

that's about making that feeling last.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
49
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,908
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,081
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,590
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,216
You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,846
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,015
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,310
-If you can get your leg up, go for it.
-Take me up.

56
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,855
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,901
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,448
-We'll just pick up where we left off.
-Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,743
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,413

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,626
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,378
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,506
It's all right.

64
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,346
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,433
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

66
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,270
Sky?

67
00205315, 732 =-> 00:05:19,861
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent--

68
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,822
I am.

69
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,330
Prepare yourself.

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,006
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so....

71
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,219
You're sure you can do this?

72
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,181

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Yeah.

73
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,428
I'l, do: thet...

74
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,766
What the hell, man?

75
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,020
What, I can't work a scale now?

76
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,232
This is bullshit. Just say it.

77
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,817
Just say the words.

78
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,278
You think I'm stealing.

79
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,670
Walk with who you are.

80
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,882
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

81
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,718
...back when I first started
coming to meetings.

82
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,805
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

83
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,645

But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

84
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,941
...that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

85
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,862
I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

86
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,908
See some hands? First time?

87
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,334
Great. Welcome.

88
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,003
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

89
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,297
Say whatever's on your mind.

90
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,217
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

91
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,598
Yeah. My name is Andrea....

92
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,064
We don't bite. No judgments.

93
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,484
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

94
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,823
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

95)
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,705
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

96
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,212
Hey, what's up?

97

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,548
My name's Jesse.

98
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,844
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,097
And this is, I believe, Peter?

100
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,142
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

101
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,570
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

102
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,197
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

03

00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,950
...with Grandpa Anus

watching every move I make.

04
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,078
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

05
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,622
-Great, right on.
-Yeah.

06
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,001
So how's it selling?

07
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,669
Mad volume?

08
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,464
Mean, Tt.’ Saas

 

09
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,091
You know, it's....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
110
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,677
It's not so good.

111
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,431
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

112
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,892
I sold a teenth.

113
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,354
-One teenth? That's it?
-Yeah.

114
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,647
To who?

15
00209%25,315 == 002098 27,067
To him.

116
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,989
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

117
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09: 36,659
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

18

00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,288
I'm out risking my ass

to get product for you two...

19
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,249
..and you're too pussy to sell?

20
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,211
You're pathetic.

 

21

00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,798

You know what? I want it back.
All. of ut.

-I'll sell it myself.
-Come on, man. Don't be like that.

123
00%09753,510 s=> 002098 57,138
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

124
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,557
It's not so easy like you think.

125
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:04, 687
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

126
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,151
-Thank you.
-All right.

127

See you next week.

-No, go ahead.

Andrea, right?

130

-Yeah.
-Hey, my name's Jesse...

 

131
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,345
...and I don't really
wanna be here either.

132
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,226
Sorry.

Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

 

34
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,918
No.
35
00: 209,419 --> 00: 211,462
Your dad is.
36
00: 216,217 --> 00: 218,970
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?
37
O0811419,137 s=> 00211921222
Are you that boring?
38
00: 221,680 --> 00: 724,058
I'm comforting.
39
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,812
I'm a comforting presence.
40

Hey, so check it out.
41
00: 240,200 --> 00: 742,202
See what that means?

Check out the date.

Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

144

00:11:49,375 =-> 00:11:55,381
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

145

--> 00:11:59,052
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

146
O02T1 $59,219 == 008125 01,679
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

147
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,807
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

148
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,893
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

149
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,313
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

150
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,692
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

51
00%12714,859 ==> 00312319,572
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a ‘Stang.

52
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,117
A 'Stang.
53

00212 $23, 701, == 008125 26,579
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

 

54
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,874
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

155
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,088
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

156
O02T2 §35y672 == 008123 39,259
Well, I think that this is....

157
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,929
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so....

159
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,643
Okay.

160
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,189
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...

161
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,944
..in Grabber Lime
with a shaker hood.

Oh, darn it, no pencil.

00713:29,559 =-> 00:13:33,229
What is

"Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,192
It's a loan out, it's fine.

008132 38,3859 =—> 00313: 40,361
Whose loan out?

67
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,239
It's fine. Really.

68
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,908
Dees

69
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47, 660
-have a guy.

00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,496
Okay.

171
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,751
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

72
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,047
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

1713:
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,008
Yes. My guy is a top...

174
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,885
-...guy.
-Who is he?

175
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,637
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

176

00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:12,226
Walt, this money
as to be unimpeachable...

177
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,896
-when it reaches Hank and Marie.

 

178
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,482
And it is. It will be.

 

179
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,861
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

 

 

180
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,323
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

181
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,075
Do you really wanna know?

82
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,830
Really?

83
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,200
What a pleasure it is to have you.

84
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,745
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

85
008152 12,912 => 0015: 16,290
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

 

 

86
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:21,129
Walt never told me how lucky he was--
Prior to recent unfortunate events.

 

187
O0815¢21,295 s=> 002158 24,382
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

188
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,177
...only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

189
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,142
That's a joke. That's a joke.

190
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,936
It's funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

191
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,689
Here, please, sit down.

192
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:45,194
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

 

 

193
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,655
Yes, I do. I have...

.+..concerns.

195
00215:51,200 =-> 00:15:53,286
If we're going to go down this road...

196
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,539
...and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law--

197
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,835
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

198
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,174
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

199
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,844
...in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

200
OO#L6: 10,011. —“ 00s.163: 12,972
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

201
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,477
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

202
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,606
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans--

203
00s16:21,772 =-> 00:16:24,317
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually--

204
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,694
I know what money laundering is.

205
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,406

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-Well.
-Yeah.

206
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,452
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

207
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:39,040
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

208
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,791
That's simple.

209
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,213
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

210
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,798
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

211
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,384
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.
212
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,556
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

2.

3

00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,225

There you

2

have it.

 

4

00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01, 604
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo...

215
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,317
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

216
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09, 487
.-who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
217
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,197
It's a win-win for everyone.

218
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah, but you can't sell that

for very long--

219
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

220
00217:16,953 ==> 00:17:19,622
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

 

221
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,669
...then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

229
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,712
Investment in what?

223
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,714
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

224
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,008
Laser tag.

225
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,055
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet

of rollicking fun...

226

00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,724
..in the heart

of northern Bernalillo County.

 

 

227
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,769
Laser tag?

228
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,107
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests--

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

229
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,151
Yeah, no, no. I actually--
I know what it is.

230
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,405

It's just that in relation to Walt, it's....

231
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,616
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

232
00217756,200 ==> 00:17:59,370
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

233
00¢17359,537 => 00:18:03,791
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

234
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,712
...buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

235
00818: 07,878 “> 002182 12,133
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

236
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,552
Plus, they got bumper boats, so....

237
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,095
"Hey, everybody...

238
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:21,225
...Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue."

239
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:25,980
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

242
002183 31,7386 ==> 00218s 34,113
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

243

...successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

244

I'm cleaned out of anything else.

we're not supposed to.

Yeah.

I've heard it over and over
and over again.
253
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,713
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

254
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,592
...that society says beer is okay...

255
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:41,472
...and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

256
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,936
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

257
00219:47,103 =-> 00:19:50,815
...from something
that lifts you off the ground?

258
00:19:53,484 --> 00:20:00,783
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

259
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,412

everything is interesting.

Jesse, this is Brock.

278
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,444
So you have a kid, huh?

279
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,112
What's up?

280
00222 402,696 ==> 00:22: 04,573
Brock, huh?

281
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,284
That's a cool name.

282
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,080
Here, give it up.

283
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,594
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

284
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,722
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

285
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,019
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

286
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,231
He's gonna go play with his Legos

Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

290
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,824
The convertible one?

291
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,703
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

292
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,833
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

293
00#22:56,458 => 00:22:57,543
..is neither.

294
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,881
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

295
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,966
...-but he knows what he's doing.

296
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,636
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

297
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,847
Well, it's a little late on that.

298
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,934
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

My involvement in this is ongoing.

302
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,538
Understand?

303
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,583
I can't just quit.

304
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:43,130
I have something of a contract.

305
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,300
But it's all very safe, professional.

306
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
Structured.

307
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,429

You worked here four years.

312
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,652
It's a business you understand.

-Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

Firecrackers?

349
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,848
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

350

-Tomas.

-Yeah?

Come on, eat your food, Brock.

Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

Hey, that's mine.

All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

368
00228322,242 == 002285 26,163
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner...

What in God's name is a Danny?

00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,856
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

377
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,653
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

378

...teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

379
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,449
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

380

When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

381
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:10,082
...he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

382
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,253
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

383
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,298
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

384

That guy, the guy with the eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,331
So he did it.

443
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,793
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

444
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,464
Who did he say he killed?

445
00233228,423 --> 00:33:30,383
Some dealer.

446
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,763
From some outside crew.

447
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,684
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

448
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,774

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

449
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,571
Off of Central?

450
00933452,089 == 0033s 55,825
Like over by the train tracks?

451
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,788
When was this?

452
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,250
Few months back.

453
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,631
What else did he tell you?

454
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,347
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

455
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,517
Shot him dead.

456
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,856
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

457
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,739
It won't happen again.

458
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,659
Not to my son.

459
00234:53,925 ==> 00:34:55,760
Guess what.

460
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:01,349
People who say "guess what" and

then actually expect you to guess...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
461
00235201, 516 --> 00735: 03,351
...I hate those people.

462
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,186
Well, I just heard...

463
00235:05,3853 <--> 00735: 10,108
..-about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank...

464
008353 10,275 => 00%3.52 13,695
..-who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

465
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,698
Isn't that fantastic?

466
00:35:17,907 =-> 00:35:20,243
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

467
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,622
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

468
00:35:23,788 --> 00°35: 25,415
Hey.

469
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,669
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

470
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,965
-I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
-Hank, this isn't about insurance.

471
002354 34,132 == 00735: 38,595
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

472
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:42,515
-I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Hank, you get stronger every day.

473
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,726
You don't need to be in a hospital.

474
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,979
In this condition, yeah, I do.

475
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,066
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

476
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,111
-You'll have all the same equipment.
-Same equipment? What's that mean?

477
00:35:55,278 =-> 00:35:59,199
The equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

478
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,452
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great...

479
002363 02,619 ==> 0073.6: 05,413
...because you'll be home.

480
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08, 958
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

481
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,252
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

482
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,047
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

483
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,592
-I got you a new bed--
-A hospital bed?

484
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,552
Well--

485
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,430
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

486
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,391
Hank...

487
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,142
...you'll be home.

488
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,312
You get that out of my house.

489
00#36:29,521. => 00:36: 31,481
You hear me, Marie?

490
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,066
Today.

491
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,695
-Hank--
-I leave this hospital...

492
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,699
..when I walk out of here.
You understand?

493
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,452
And not before.

494
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,082
What's a Danny?

495
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,084
Danny's an accomplice.

496
00836: 51,251. <-> 0023.63 56,005
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

497
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,633
..-who's paid to look the other way.

498
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,888
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

499
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,851
..without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

500
00237208,017 --> 00:37:12,272
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

501
00237:13,189 =-> 00:37:15,150
Easier said than done.

502
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,611
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

503
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,168
What about me?

504
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,006
What about you?

505
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,633
Me.

506
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,553
I'll be the Danny.

507
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,182
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

508
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,642
I'm capable of managing

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
a small business.

509
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,478
A legal business, not this.

510
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,104
Who else could we trust?

511
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,315
-No.
-Walt...

512
00237 i555 7382 == 002375 5,192
...I'm in this.

513
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,361
-And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
-No.

 

514
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,532
-You are not in this. You are not--
-We're married, how am I not in this?

515
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,202
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

516
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,921
Right?

517
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:26,095
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

518
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,395
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

519
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,817
So there's that.

520
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,761

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Jesse. Jesse.

521
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,180
Respirator.

522
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,392
Right.

523
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,247
Yes?

524
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,466
Yes, all right. Okay.

525
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,511
Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,682
What was that?

527
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,769
An invitation.

528
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,333
Walter, you're right on time.

529
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,668
Please, come in.

530
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,638
I hope you like paila marina.

531
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,515
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

532
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,563
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

533)
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,571
Come on. You can help me cook.

534

00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:55,745

This is a Chilean dish that I love...

535

00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,414
...but I never get to make it.

536

00:40:59,123 --> 00:4

00:4

00:4

00:4

00:4

00:4

Wou

00:4

00:4

Why

00:4

Kids won't eat i

537
201,542 --> 00:4
But...

538
204,003 --> 00:4

..you know how tha

93.9,
207,340 --> 00:4
Sure.

540
212,804 --> 00:4
Do you mind?

541
215,056 =-->
d you slice

00:4

542
219,769 --> 00:4
Very thin.

543
229,445 --> 00:4

did you

544

233,700 --> 00:4

200,750
t.

203,503

206,089

t is.

208,925

214,222

217,934

the garlic?

221,729

232,073

invite me here?

235,618

We're working together...

00:4

545
735,785 --> 00:4

..why not break bread

00:4

 

546

¢ 38,121
together?

 

239,998 --> 00:4
Now, the garlic

547

242,625
ie
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,646
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

548
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,150
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

549
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:11,154
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

550
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,489
I mean, not very much at all.

551
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:19,078
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

552
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,582
...instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

 

553
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,042
How is that possible?

554
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,670
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

555
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,633
Neural connections are formed.

556
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,389
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

557
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:43,603
...that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

558
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,064
Where memory is stored.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

...I would like to help you,

559
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:51,819
It's something called
relational memory.

560
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,450

Don't quote me on that, I'm....

561
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,495
I'm rusty on my biology.

562
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
That's very interesting.

563
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,752
Walter...

564
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,379

565
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,425
Help me how?

566
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,137

Well, when I first started out,

I made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,224
More than I care to admit.

 

568
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,852
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

569
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,773

...because this life of ours...

570
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,776
...it can overwhelm.

571A
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,533

if I ¢ould.
You are a wealthy man now.

572
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,078
And one must learn to be rich.

573
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,581
To be poor, anyone can manage.

574
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,546
What advice do you have for me?

575
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,926
Never make the same mistake twice.

576
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,469
Hey.

577
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,763
What's up?

578
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45, 933
You...? You Tomas?

579
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,977
I heard you were the man.

580
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,937
Yeah, what you want?

581
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,193
Crystal.

582
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,445
You think you could hook me up?

583
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,365
-Three hundred.
-For a teenth?

00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,870
Hey, guys.

2
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,465
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

3
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55, 676
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

4
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,972
...and you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

5
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,308
Sure.

6
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,062
But I'm good?

7
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,482
Yeah, you're great. Why?

8
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,402
Are my feet okay?

9
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,745
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

10
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,498

I know it's not the right way and all...

11
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,919
...but once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

12
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,924
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B...

13

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

002034 36,1383 ==> 00203: 38,802
...then who am I to argue?

14

00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,313

Ha.

1:5

00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:55,277

18

216,298 --> 00:04:18,967

-All right.
-Thank you.

19

219,676 --> 00:04:20,802

-Got it?
-Yeah.

20

221,011 --> 00:04:23,346

Okay. All right.

21

-So 9 a.m. Saturday?
-Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.

22

04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,145

So which means

pick me up about 8:30?

23

00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,981
-I'll be here with bells on.

-What?

24

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,985

Don't worry,

It's just a saying.
I won't be wearing bells.
25
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,070
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.

26
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,114
-Hi. Do you have a minute?
-Yeah.

27
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43, 658
-Could you keep an eye on your sister?
-Sure.

28
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,160
-Thanks.
-See you, Dad.

29.
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,038
-Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
-Thank you.

30
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,006
Have you thought any more
about what we discussed?

31
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,511
"Thought any more"
meaning reconsidered? No.

32
00205: 02,719 => 00:05: 05,180
So show me the flaw in it.

33
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:10, 602
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

34
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,147
Where do you want me to start?

35
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:19, 361
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
36
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,032
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

37
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,201
You took the money
you won gambling...

38
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,870
..invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

39
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,500
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

40
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36, 837
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

41
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,840
You should just take this money
that I give you...

42
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,133
...and not look too closely at it.

43
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:46,721
So if, God forbid, I get caught...

44
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,432
...you maintain plausible deniability.

45
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,436
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

46
002052537645 --> 00705: 57,232
.-made $43,000 a year,
starts shoveling money at me.

47
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,901

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

48
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,572
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me." Really?

49
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,284
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

50
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,202
I tell you what, Walt...

51
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,581
...I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

52
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,291
...than some complete idiot.

53
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,881
So you're promoting caution here.

54
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25, 302
And you want a believable story.

55
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28, 680
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

56
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34, 644
...to make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

57
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:41,318
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

58
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45, 488
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
59
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,787
Because he loves his family and

desperately wants a reconciliation...

60
00706:52,996 =—> 00:06:56,791
...though it may be hopeless
and futile.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,420
Then again, he'd try anything.

62
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,303
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

63
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,806
...if the husband
were no longer estranged.

64
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,852
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

65
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,191
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

66
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28, 323
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

67
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,992
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

68
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,869
Not every night, no.

69
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,247
Six nights a week. One night off.

70
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,792
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

With 24 hours' notice.

72

Five nights a week, with no notice.

-Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
-Four.

75

Don't push it.

76
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,392
-And I want my own key to the house.
-No.

77
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,894
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

78
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,023
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

79
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:08,071
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,515
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

81
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,818
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

Get a beer with me.

84

What?

85
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,606
What the hell are you doing?

86
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,108
That's ours, right?

87
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,695
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

88
00209:36,659 ==> 00:09: 39,621
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

89
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,124
What the hell is wrong with you?

90
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,503
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

91
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,881
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

92
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,635
They had Combo shot down
in the street...

93
00209753,843 ==> 00:09:57,222
...and now it's our product
they're selling.

94
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00, 683

But look, see? I win.

Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,772
-Been playing cards with your dad?
-No. Why?

82
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,942
How is your old man?

83
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,402
Back teaching?

 

84

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,864
No. I don't think

either of them are working...

185
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,324
-... right now.
-How they swinging that?

186
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,368
-I don't know.
-Hey...

187
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,246
...did you know
the doctors told your Uncle Hank...

188
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,748
..-he can get out of here
anytime he wants?

189
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,209
Oh, yeah? That's great.

190
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,963
-Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
-Why not?

191
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,132
What? That's what they said.

192
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,925
Because they want the room.

193
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,845
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
reset the meter...

94
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,807
...and wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

95
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,270
Are you not well enough?

96

00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,566
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

 

97

00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,444
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

198
00216:26,652 =-> 00:16:29,363
I can't move my legs. Got it?

199
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,909
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

200

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,830
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

201
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,336
-Is that what you're trying to say?
-Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

202
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,898
Bitch.

203
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,818
You know I'm hourly, right?

204
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,781
He promised me
that he would be here.

205
OO817 411,989 s=> 00217213,.533.
Oh, he promised.

206
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,287
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

207
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:23,376
-Okay, so, what's plan B?
-I don't know.

208
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,879
-I really don't.
-Well, let's brainstorm.

209
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,217
-You really think he's serious?
-That's why I'm here, Saul.

210
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:36,013
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

211
00217: 36,222 =-> 00217238,349
Okay, so we pay him off.

Les

212
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,311
No, no, it's not about money.
about getting him off the streets.

213
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,189
Getting him to calm down.

214
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,358
Maybe....

215
00217:51,529 ==> 00:17:54,907
What if we, maybe...?

216
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,744
Could you get him arrested?

217
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,584

 

 

You want your criminal associate

that

taken into police custody?

 

218
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,086
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

219
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,840
But it wouldn't be anything
would get him into real trouble...

220
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,843
-and nothing that could lead back
to our business.

221
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,553
Just some minor offense.

222
00218315, 761, => 00218218,.598
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and--

223
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:23,936
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.
224
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,897
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

225
00218:27,106 ==> 00:18 31,319
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

226
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,779
That's jail.

227
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,241
You're talking about a level-two joint.

228
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,244
Something that keeps him off
the street for 30 days.

229
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,121
Then by the time he gets out...

230
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,082
...tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

231
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,211
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

232
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,381
In the past,
I've recommended Springer...

233
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,762

their bathrooms since they renovated.

It's not just delivering hamburgers.

-Patrick.

Making him kill people.

253

Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

Of course I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

I got a granddaughter

What can I do for you?

272
22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,331
Have a seat, Walter.
213
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,838
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

274

00822222, 7116 “> 00222 25,0110
-And?

-Well, I'm not gonna do it.

275
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,430
-Why?
-Because it's moronic.

276
00222 $29,223 == 00225 31,725
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

-That's not the moronic part.
-Okay. So, what's the problem?

The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

Saul?

280
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,699

Your boss.

This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

283
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,254

like always.

And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

What is?

29.1,
00223529, 742 == 00223: 32, 912
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

292
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,789
I'd get called on domestic disputes

Hundreds, probably, over the years.

294

piece of shit that I will never forget.

Wrists like little branches.

301

Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there every weekend...

302
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,868
...and one of us would
pull her aside and say:

303
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,704
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

304
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,958
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

305
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,419
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

306
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,923
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

307
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,593

Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him in a car...

308
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,388
...drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

309
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,473
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

310
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,976
Back home.

311
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,562
But one night...

312
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,900
..-my partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

313
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,444
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

314
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,364
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

315
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,491
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

316
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,704
Only that night...

S17
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59, 623
-we're driving into town...

318
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:05, 462
...and this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny Boy."

319
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,967
And it just rubbed me wrong.

320
00:25:10,175 =-> 00:25:13,887
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

321
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:18,100
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

322
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:24,314
..-.and I told him,
"This is it. This is how it ends."

323
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,609
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

324
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,154
Swearing to God
he's gonna leave her alone.

325
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,700
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

326
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,661
And I told him to be quiet.

327
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,040
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

328
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,001
And, of course, he got quiet...

 

329
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:49,339
.-.-goes still and real quiet.

330
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,677
Like a dog waiting for

dinner scraps.

331
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,764

Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

333
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,563
...and Prince Charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

334
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,779

...and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again...

336
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:21,080
...I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

337
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,087
It was just a warning?

338
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,966
Of course.

339
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,097
Just trying to do the right thing.

340
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,601
But two weeks later he killed her.

341
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,230
Of course.

342
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:51,443
Caved her head in

with the base of a Waring blender.

343
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,699
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

344
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,914
Moral of the story is...

345
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,709
...I chose a half measure...

346
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,838
...when I should have
gone all the way.

347
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,595
I'll never make that mistake again.

348
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,607
No more half measures, Walter.

349
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,625
Man, I don't get this.

350
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,713
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

351
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,049
So where are they?

352
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,428
I don't know. They're always around.

353
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,472
Burgers are getting cold.

354
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,978
So is it, like, fast?

355

00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,859
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

356
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,737
Hey, nobody's gonna
know anything.

357
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,241
-Can I have another bump?
-Look, you had your bump.

358
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,411
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

359
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26, 663

Gonna need you to come with me.

362
--> 00:30:44,593

Sit down.

00:30:55,896

I understand that you have a problem

363
--> 00:30:59,399

with two of my employees.

00:31:00,025

364
--> 00:31:03,403

It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

00:31:03,612
It is possible

00:31:06,573
But,
there was

--> 00:31:06,031
they acted rashly.

366
--> 00:31:09,409

on the other hand,

provocation.
367
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,953
The man was selling
on their territory.

368
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,792
There is blame on both sides.

369
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,632
This will go no further.

370
00#31:.23,840 => 00:31:28,303
It will be settled right here,
right now.

371
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,431
You told him?

372
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,186
Wait outside.

373
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:52,494
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

374
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,875
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

B75
O0#31: 59,084 => 002.322 03,505
And when I learned
what you intended to do....

376
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,885
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

377
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,514
...I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

378
00832212, 722 ——> 00s322 16,101
You don't look at him.

You look at me.

379
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,694
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

380
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,449
...and you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

381
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,201
And that will be the end of this.

382
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,206
No.

383
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,543
Jesse.

384
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:45,338
-Pardon me?
-They use kids.

385
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:49,342
These assholes got an 11-year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

386
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,721
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

387
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,056
This how you do business?

388
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,729
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

389
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,661
Bring them back.

Understand?

392
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,695
And you...

393
00233::54,783 --> 00:33:56,952
.you keep the peace.

394
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,333
Say it.

395
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,129
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

396
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,968
Shake hands.

397
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,556
Jesse, your actions...

398
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,060
...they affect other people.

399
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:11,693
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

403
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,405
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

404
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,170
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

405
00236212,379 --> 00736:17,258
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

406

Marie.
407

It's time to go home, Hank.
408
00236:23,431. <-> 00:36:27,102

Marie? Not

00:36:33,233

I gotta tell you,
till I'm well.

409
--> 00:36:36,403

Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
410
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,946
I'm just seeing.

414
--> 00:36:50,917
it will.

 

415
--> 00:36:54,963
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

416
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,675
It's a waste of time.

417
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,887
Besides, what if someone comes in?

418
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,433
-I don't care if someone walks in.
-What's wrong with you?

419
00237:07,5L7 ==> 00237: 11,438
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow--

420
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,189
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

421
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:17,777
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

on whether I can get a boner.

-Afraid you'll lose?

you're not completely hopeless.

You know what?

429
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,224
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

-One minute?
-Yeah.

All right. That's a cakewalk.

You know, this is just....

433
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,482
This is just sad. I mean....

I really feel sorry for you,

Marie, you know? I really do. It's just....

-It's pathetic.
-That's good, keep talking.

Protest. Struggle.

The murder of a young boy
in the South Valley.

that 11-year-old Tomas Cantillo...

of a gang-related execution.

late last night.

-Can you turn that off?

-...the city's ongoing struggle--

that peddle them. We'll be passing--

00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,670

...are thinking about
starting a business together?

501
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,881
Seriously?

502
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,842
What kind of business?

503
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,011
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

504
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,347
What do you mean? Like the...?

 

505
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,185
I'm sorry, I have to go.

506
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,261
Oh, my God.

507
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,364
Run.

00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,171
-Well, hello again.
-Hi, I hope we're not too late.

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,965
-No, no. Perfect timing.
-Okay.

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,175
-Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
-Hi.

4
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,302
-Good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,596
-Sandia Laboratories, huh?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,307
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

7
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,101
Yeah, well, you know.

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,395
Working on anything
you can talk about?

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,439
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

10
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,442
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,322
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

12
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,701
-Well, just remember I get a cut.
-All right. It's a deal.

wis)
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,954
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,164
-Sure.
-Okay.

5
00201 522,165 == 008015 25,210
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,965
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

17
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,926
-All right.

-Okay, thanks.

18
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,140
-He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
~Yeah.

19
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,978
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,022
-It's a nice big living room.
-Yeah.

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48, 984
And this is the dining area.

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,530
-Oh, the dining area. Right.
“Yes. Oh, and...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,616
..it's got a pool.

24
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,493
Pool is nice.

25
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,455
Backyard could be a little bigger.

26
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:06, 668
And-- Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,796
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

28
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,841
...and, you know,
got good appliances and....

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,760
How many bedrooms?

30
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,845
Three. Told you.

31
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,141
They're all pretty good size and--
Oh, this is the first one here.

32
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,769
And then there's two more
at the back.

33
00%02123,977 s=> 002023 25,,896
Only three bedrooms?

34
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,857
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

35.
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,525
-Five?
-Yeah.

36
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,403
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

37
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,992
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

38
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,703
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

39
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,082
»..SoO that I can work at home
and you can write.

40
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,087
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

41
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,216
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

42
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,220
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

43
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,391
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

44
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,562
-At least, higher than here.
-Walt, this is a good neighborhood.

45
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,899
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
46
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:16,071
..and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

47
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,949
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

48
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,119
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

49
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,037
Truly. I mean, why...?

50
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,417
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,919
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

52
00703:31,128 =-> 00:03:32,921
I'm serious.

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,591
Come on. Why be cautious?

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,678
We've got nowhere to go but up.

55
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,231
-Yeah.
-Walter, you see us?

56
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,983
Yeah. I see you.

57
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:03,071
I'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,200
And then what?
I'm gonna need some....

59
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,453
Some kind of assurance.

60
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,582
I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here...

61
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,501
-if it makes you feel any better.

62
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,351
Walter, you've been busy.

63
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,355
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

64
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,123
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

65
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,293
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

66
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,337
I need my sleep.

67
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,508
You said no half measures.

68
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:52,389
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

69
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,518
-You get your car fixed?
-Not yet.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

70
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,020
You're gonna wanna
get your car fixed.

71
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,190
Let's see how this goes first.

72
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,060
Has your condition worsened?

73
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,022
-Excuse me?
-Your medical condition.

74
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,150
-Has it grown worse?
-Not that I know of, no.

75
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,902
Is there a ringing in your ears?

76
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,655
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

77
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,578
-I'm quite well, thank you.
-No. Clearly, you are not.

78
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,165
No rational person would do
as you have done.

79
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,252
Explain yourself.

80
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,216
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

81
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,885

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I intervened.

82
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,512
Some worthless junkie.

83
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,766
For him, you intervene
and put us all at risk.

84
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,770
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

85
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,439
That's right. He couldn't.

86
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,108
He was angry
because those dealers of yours...

87
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,444
...had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

88
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,488
I heard about it.

89
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,449
He should have
let me take care of them.

90
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,451
Maybe.

91
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,789
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

92
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:49,339
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

93

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00209350, 965 ==> 007093 53,635
I would never ask you that.

 

94
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,059
Where is Pinkman now?
95
00:10:03,144 =--> 00:10:05,313
I wouldn't know.
96
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,025
Couple of time zones away, at least.
97
002103 09,567 ==> 00210: 12,529
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.
98
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:17,158

 

He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

 

 

99
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,952
You'll never find him.
00
00710:19,160 --> 00:10:21,037
I don't know, Walt...
01
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,457
-it's what do, after all.
02
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,378
He's out of the picture.
03
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,674

 

I saved his life,

I owed him that,

but now he and I are done.

104
00%10732,882 =-> 00:10:36,052
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

105
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,018
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
106
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,689
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

107
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,776
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

08
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,987
Option A:
09

00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,030
You kill me right here and now.

0
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,075
Apparently,

I have made that very easy for you.

al
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,870
You can kill me, no witnesses...

2
O0#11:02,078 => 00s112 05,874
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

 

 

3

00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,918

...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

114
008114 09,377 === O0PTIs 13,506
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

5
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,341
What is option B?

116
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,926
I continue cooking.

117
OO#LL: Lay 594 <-> 00s112 19,929
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
118
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,390
We forget this ever happened.

119
00#11:22,599 =-> 00:11:25,226
We consider this a lone hiccup...

120
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:30,273
..-in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

Qe.
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,444
I prefer option B.

22
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,286
You'd need a new assistant.

23
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,623
-I could get right on that.
-No.

24
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,125
This time, I choose.

25
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,935
YOUL Gas.a.s
26

00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,770
...get it fixed.

27
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,605
Yeah.

28
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,854
Really?

29
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,925
It's good to see you.

 

 

 

30
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,387
Thanks.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
31
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,640
It's good to be back.

32
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,476
Well, shall we?

33
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,689
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

 

34
0013:42,405 =-> 00:13:45,533
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

 

 

135

00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,368
-No.
-No?

136
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,204
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

37
00813: 50,413 => 00s13: 53,416
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

38
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,418
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

39
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,671
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

 

40

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,426
-Plus, there's that big nose of his.
-That's not a nose, that's a horn.

141
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,889
-Is that so?
-His real nose is little.

142
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,393

I learn all
being

00:14:15, 646
Okay, June bug,

00:14:17,774

kinds of things
with you.

143
--> 00:14:17,565
these are for you.

144
--> 00:14:20,068

-What about the rest?
-The rest are for me.

00:14:20,276
No,

145
--> 00:14:22,779

they're not.

You're too old for balloons.

00:14:24,447

146
--> 00:14:28,451

You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

00:14:28,659

147
--> 00:14:30,870

I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

00:14:31,079
-Bye,

-Bye,

Please, no.

you wanna tell me?

00:18:03,165

152

Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

00:18:06,127

-I don't do nothing for them ever.

154
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,301
They try and make me. I say, no.

155
00218:13,509 =-> 00:18:18,639
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

156
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,309
You're a business--
The lady out front--

157
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,146
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

58
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,454
She says, yes.

59
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,292
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

 

60
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,961
Good. She's good driver.

61
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,797
Licensed? Dependable?

62
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,382
She has a Camry.

63
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,176
Good.

 

64
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,183

that you return our calls next time.

166
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,564
So have her drive you to the hospital.

167
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,863
She's gonna need her shoe.

168
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,543
-Where'd they cross?
-Laredo, looks like.

169
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,380
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

70
O0s19:32,588 => 00719235,591
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

71
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,762
Probing for weakness.

72
00219: 41,097 ==> 00.19243,557
Well, they didn't find any.

73
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,437
What about Pinkman?

74
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,899
I'm making inquiries.

00:20:07,790 =--> 00:20:11,585
Yeah, that's two.

All right, let's close it up.

You can take your mask off now.

80

Does that guy ever leave?

81
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,505
When exactly did that start?

82
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,924
It's new.

-Sorry to hear that.
-No, it'll be fine.

Yeah, it'll be fine.

By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me--

No. No,

I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.
208
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,350
I need to talk to you
about something.

209
00223: 54,683 => 00:23:56,977
Something rather pressing.

210
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,859
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

00:24:04,068

--> 00:24:07,947

...-how soon you might be able

to take over th

00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,324

You and an

2
00:24:10,991

assistant.

--> 00:24:12,785

Why would...?

 

2

4

00:24:13,994

--> 00:24:18,123

-Why would push come to shove?
-Has Walter ever talked to you...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
215
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:22,002
...about why he got into
this particular line of work?

21:6
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,464
I guess assumed
it was because it pays so well.

217
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,301
It is, but specifically...

 

218
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,513
..-has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

219
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,603
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

220
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,023
What exactly
are his health problems?

22.1.
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,526
He's dying of cancer.

222
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,990
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

223
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,369
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

224
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,125
How long does he have?

225
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,379
That is very much the question.

226
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,925

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him....

227
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:16,682
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

228
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,645
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

229
00#25%.22,229 => 00:25: 26,814
-No, I understand.
-I have a very large investment in this.

230
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,154
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

231
002254 30,362 ==" 00225231, 697
Not even for a week.

232
O0e253 31,905 => 00225:35,.325
So you understand my concern.

233
001254 35,535 --> 00:25:38,536
And my desire for continuity.

234
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,205
I do. Absolutely.

235
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,585
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

236
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,714
...assuming that
he's physically up to it.

237
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:54,595
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
238
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:59,725
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

23.9
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,978
Well, worst-case scenario....

240
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,279
I suppose if we had...

...at least a few more cooks together.

...he is such a....

00#26:.25,292 => 00:26:26,502
A master.
246

00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29, 963
There's always more for me to learn.

247
00:26:32,132 =-> 00:26:36,929
But I'm thinking that if we had...

248
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,931
.say...

249
00%26:39,515 ==> 003268 41,350

One more...

251,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
...I guess would do it. I suppose.

252
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,947
I believe in you, Gale.

253
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:00,661
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

254
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,800
What's up?

255
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,101
Walt, is there...?

256
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,651
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

257
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:40,658
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

258
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,270
Yeah?

259
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10, 688
Tell him I'm in conference.

260
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,867
-I'm in conference.
-I'm looking to find a client of yours.

261
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24, 828
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

262

-Which client?
-Jesse Pinkman.

-I need your full attention, Saul.

Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

267
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,392
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

268
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,854
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

269
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:56,235
-Let me tell you something, Mike, you--
-Whoa, you are good right there.

270
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,571
Now, let's both get comfortable.

271
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,661
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

272
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,163
..we both know why, don't we?

213
00229208,372 --> 00:29:13,835
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

274
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,420

Look, Mike...

275
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,382
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.

276
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,634
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

277
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,178
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

278
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,514
That's something I provide for you.

279
00229:3.25,722 =—> 00%29:27,557
So if I give up Pinkman...

280
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,228

"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

281
00229:31,436 =-> 00:29: 33,939
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

282
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,108
So then, where's the trust?

283
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,779
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

284
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,450
Yeah, that's an argument.

285
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,619

Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

288
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,137
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I....

289
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:11,268
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just--
I couldn't live with myself.

I'm sorry.

291
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,109

the address down in my day planner?

292

Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

293

Do not touch anything on my desk.

make myself a Nescafé.

00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,522
Holy Christ.

310
00232320, 730 => 00:32:23, 733
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

311
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,736
-My car is bugged?
-I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

312
00%32726,945 ==> 00232: 30,115
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

313
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,202
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

314
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,581
...threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

315
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,084
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

316
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,253
You and I survive this...

317
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,922
..-I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

318
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,301
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

319
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,303
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

320
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,849

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

321
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,727
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

822
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,314
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

B23:
002332 09,821. ——> 00.333 12,073
So how you holding up?

324
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,578
You?

325
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,080
I got my old job back.

326
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,584
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

327
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,422
-So he's their boy, huh?
-He's their boy.

328
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,008
How long you think you've got?

329
00233¢ 31,343 --> 0033: 35,305
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

330
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,643
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

331
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,479
...listening to every word I say.

332

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,943
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

333
00233:48,151. => 00:33:53,114
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method....

334
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,539
So, what do we do?

335
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,545
You know what we do.

336
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,722
There's got to be some other way.

337
00234:19,349 <-> 00:34:23,019
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

338
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:28,441
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

339
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,569
..-but for your family.

340
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34, 864
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

341
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,034
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

342
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:43,248
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

343
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,919
We had a good run.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
344
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,089
But it's over.

345
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,303
Never the DEA.

346
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,432
The cook can't stop.

347
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,936
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

348
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,439
Gus can't afford to.

349
008352 07,814 => 0023.52 11,151
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

350
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15, 614
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

351
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,242
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

B52
00#35.20,619 => 00:35:24,956
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

353
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:38,470
I can't do it, Mr. White.

354
00235: 39,888 => 00:35: 42,057
Like you said, I'm....

355
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,185
I'm not a....

356
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,813

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I can't do it.

357
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,363
I'll do it.

358
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,494
I'm gonna need your help.

359
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,871
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

360
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,333
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

361
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,169
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

362
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,090
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

363
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,052
...and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

364
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,098
But: ict. could justia.

365
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,226
...Shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

366
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,895
evel think then that... .

367
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31, 690
I may be able...

368
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,070

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...to make it look like an accident.

369
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,617
There's got to be some other way.

370
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,704
I'm all ears.

371
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,750
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

372
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,545
I'm truly sorry...

373
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,756
...but it's gonna be him.

374
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01, 386
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

315
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,514
...as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

376
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,059
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

377
00237:08,268 =-> 00:°87:10,437
And I'll do the rest.

378
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,114
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

379
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,079
Are you gonna save mine?

380
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,235
Yeah?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
381
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,111
Please, tell me you found him.

382
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,992
6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.
Apartment 6.

383
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,998
-You there?
-Yeah.

384
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,503
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

385
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,342
-He's home?
-Yep.

386
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,803
Anyone watching the place?

387
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,598
No. Looks pretty much wide-open.

388
002393 11,015 == 007393 13,017
When are you gonna do it?

389
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18, 982
Tonight.

390
00:39:19,190 --> 007392 21,359
Once it gets dark.

391
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,657
Don't do this, Mr. White.

392
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:32,036
Please. Go to the cops.

393
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,236
We got a problem.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
394
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,197
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

395
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,074
Better come with me.

396
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,538
I'll follow you.

397
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,876
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

398
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,944
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

399
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,447
...-but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

400
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,120
After you.

401
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:44,502
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

402
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,300
Please, don't do this.

403
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,511
Mike...

404
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,305
-you don't have to do this.

 

405
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,435
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

 

406

00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,186
Downstairs.

407
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,649
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

408
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,484
-No.
-If I could talk to Gus--

409

00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,570
-No.

-...I can make him understand.

410
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,072
If could talk to Gus,

I can convince him.

411
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,116
Just let me, please-- Please.

412

00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:19,078

-Please, let me talk to him.
-Shut up! Shut up.

 

 

413
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:24,083
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

414
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29, 338
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

415
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,009
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

416
00%42:33,217 ==> 00342736, 971
And without him, we would--
And he's in town, all right?

417
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,849
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
418
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,352
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

419
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,897
I'll take you right to him.

420
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,526
-What do you say?
-Where is he?

421
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,697
-Right now, you give me an address.
-I don't-- He moves. He moves around.

422
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,658
But if you let me call him--
No, no, please.

423
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,536
No, I just-- My phone. I'll just--

424
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:04,874
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

425
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,210
All right? Okay?

426
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,087
Okay?

427
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,877
Did you do it?

428
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,465
Mr. White?

429
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,801
Did you do it?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
430
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,303
No, I didn't do it.

431
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,306
I can't now.

432
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,602
-It's gonna have to be you.
-What? No way, man.

433
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,939
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

434
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,775
They've got me,
they're going to kill me.

435
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,194
-Jesse, do it now! Do it!
-Son of a bitch!

436
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,654
Do it, Jesse! Do it!

437
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,582
Just what the hell was that exactly?

438
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,500
You might wanna hold off.

439
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,169
Yeah?

440
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,298
-Why?
-Because your boss is gonna need me.
441
