00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,671
How's it coming?

2
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,048
Very, very well.

3
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,219
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,264
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,141
It's exciting.

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01, 937
It's really coming together.
And I'd like to point out...

7
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,898
...that if you have
any understandable questions...

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,109
..-about the price tag....

9
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,738
That sound? Quality.

10
00201211,905 => 00701216,493
At Pfizer, at Merck,
that unit would be right at home.

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,203
That goes for all of it.

12
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,791
Good. I want you
to have what you need.

13
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,671

Well, I doff my proverbial cap
to you, sir.

14
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,089
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

5
00201230,257' --> 00:01:31,592
Within a month, I'd say.

6
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,469
Two weeks.

7
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,683
Or, yeah, two weeks.

8
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,810
Good. Very good.

 

9
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,564
By the way,
that sample you asked me to run?

20
OO#01L: 45,731. ——> 00: 012 51,'612
-I ran it, and it is quite good.
-Thank you very much, Gale.

 

 

21
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,740
-You can give that to Victor to discard.
-Sure.

22
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,451
Is that our competition?

23
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,329
-I'm sorry?
STNG: «ss

24
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,581
It really is quite good.

25
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:07,044

The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

26
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,506
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color...

27
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,093
..-but if that is our competition...

28
00202:15,260 ==> 00:02:18,597
-we have our work cut out for us,
so to speak.

 

29
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,726
You don't have any competition, Gale,
not as far as I'm concerned.

30
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,480
After all, how pure can pure be?

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,984
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,324
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you
a purity of 96 percent.

33
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41, 453
I'm proud of that figure.
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,040
However, this other product is 99.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,502
Maybe even a touch beyond that.

36
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,963
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph...

37

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,507
...to say for sure...

38
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,885
..-but that last 3 percent...

39
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:01,264
..-it may not sound like a lot,
but it is.

40
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,433
It's tremendous.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,437
It's a tremendous gulf.

42
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:13,276
Gale, for our purposes,
96 percent will do just fine.

43
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,530
Please, don't let this trouble you.

44
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,158
Yeah. It's just....

45
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,996
I'd love to know
who synthesized it, is all.

46
002035275833 == 008035 29,793
A man who wants to work with me.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,003
A trained chemist, like yourself.

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,589
But it won't happen.

49
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,092
I don't consider him a professional.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,140
If he's not,
I don't know what that makes me.

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm not trying
to talk myself out of a job--

52
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,896
With this person,
there are other considerations.

53
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,735
His is the best I've ever seen,
hands down.

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,906
And I look at this place
that you've built...

55
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,367
...the money you're investing...

56
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,953
...Sparing no expense.

57
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,414
And I know...

58
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,754
..I know that you want the best.

59
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,857
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

60
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,568
No, no. Eubank's west.

61

00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,614

It's between Eubank and Spain,
but Mazatlan's closest.

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
I don't know. I just heard the one...

63
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,954
...-like, you know, a backfire,
a truck backfiring.

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,706
I came out of my apartment.
A couple came out.

65
00:05:31,873 =-> 00:05:33,667
No. No, nobody saw.

66
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,335
Did you guys see anybody?

67
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,840
Guys, did you--? I don't know
if they speak English too good.

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,175
I don't think they saw anybody.

69
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:46,012
It was just this one loud--
This very loud pop and that was all.

70
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,765
No arguing or like that.

71
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,395
So you guys good in directions there?
You want me to...?

12
00205754,312 ==> 00:05: 56,940
They coming east or west?

73
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:01,695
If heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
74
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,490
Then it's straight residential.
You want me to what? Yeah.

75
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,909
No. I'll stay on the line.

76
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,832
You know him?

77
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,586
We all heard this shot.
I don't think you ought to go in there.

78
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,256
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't wanna touch anything.

79
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,091
Mister?

80
00206:25,010 --> 00:06:27,596
Mister, are you listening to me?

81
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,198
Little bastard.

82
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,161
Drive.

83
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,163
Drive.

84
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
What the hell happened?

 

85
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,512
He's gone?

86
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,849
Look at me.

00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:

Gone?

88

00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:

You sure?

89

00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:

-Gone. Splattered all
-Oh, Jesus.

90

00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:
Jesus. Oh, shit.

91

00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:

All right.

92

00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:

SOwsss

93

00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:

Shit.

00:08:56,661 --> 00:08

55,410

259,956

-All right, you do a sweep?
-Couldn't. People there.

95
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09

205,128

People? He get himself seen
by these people?

96
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09
What about you?

97
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09
What about you?

98
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09
Yeah. So what?

99
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09

206,588

711,009

213,470

217,390
Just another looky-loo.

100
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,613
I guess I'd better get this over with.

101
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,726
Hey.

102
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,854
Oh, jeez, I woke you up.
I woke you up.

103
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,982
No, no, no, it's okay.
I needed to get up anyway.

104
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,692
Are you coming in?

105
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,320
No. It's kind of my only time
to run errands.

 

 

 

 

06
00#10212,487 => 00:10 13,947
I just needed to....
07
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,451
rey
08
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,412
Sorry.
09
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,831
It's okay.
10
00:10:22,997 =-> 00:10:27,919
And thank you, big time, as always.
11
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,298

They seem to be getting bigger
instead of smaller.

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

172
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,677
Not really sure what that's all about.

113
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,304
Please, for God's sake...

114
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,349
-tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you.

15

00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,102
Absolutely not, okay?
It's absolutely fine.

6
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,062
Okay.

7
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,861
Does this mean
what I think it means?

 

 

8
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,031

-What?
-You and Walt?

ifahe)
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59, 367
What?

120
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,495
His car is in the driveway.

It's not a state secret.

121
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,916

I-- All right. Okay. I'm not pressing.

T, Just. . se

 

 

122.
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,252
I think that it's great.

123
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,337
That's all, all right?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

124
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,006
-I'm out of here.
-Okay.

125
O0#11L:13,173 <-> 00s112 18,428
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

126
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,124
--in Albuquerque today.

127

00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,379
But you know what? It always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.

 

128
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,183
--the morning commute,
northbound 25...

12:9)
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,270
.-we've got a two-car accident
on the right shoulder.

130
00#12:50,436 <-> 00s12: 53,314
You gotta be careful.
Also, from the west side...

131
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,277
..we've got another accident,
Paseo del Norte and Second Street.

132
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,530
That one's on the left shoulder,
so be on the lookout.

133:
00213: 00,697 => 00213: 03,866
That's a look at your morning commute
on Coyote 102.5.

134
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,786
Oh, hey.

135

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

002133 48,953 ==> 00213: 51,247
-Breakfast?
~Yeah.

36
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,333
Yeah? Okay.

37
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,257
All right. What you want?

38
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,116
All right, look.

39
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,578
So I make it 10 to 9, which means--—

 

40
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,831
Shut up.
41

00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,046
Which means we need to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes...

42
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,756
.to keep to our schedule.

43
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,592
Gus' schedule.

44
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,514
And as angry as he may be,

I don't believe he's willing...

 

 

45
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,349
...to forfeit an entire batch.

46
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,310
That just might make him angrier.

 

47
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,024
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,804
He's nowhere to be found.

162
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,181

I'm not the man's keeper,
but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

Mr. Goodman,

something is going on.

 

 

168

Why would he leave his car
in my driveway?

169
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,534
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

170
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,246
He carpools?
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

171
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,082
Hey, you're breaking up there.

No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

My driver's license, my checkbook.
I have to start canceling all that.

We could've been stabbed.

But without proof of residency....

I cannot believe this day.

All right,
let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

247
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,428
He was a good man
and a good chemist...

248
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,514
...and I cared about him.

249
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,768
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

250
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,729
He didn't deserve it at all.

25.1
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:41,071
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.

252
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:45,951
When you make it Gale versus me,
or Gale versus Jesse...

253
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,496
...Gale loses, simple as that.

254
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,254
This is on you, Gus.
Not me, not Jesse.

255

Gale's death is on you.

256
002302 02,217 => 00330704, 761
I mean, really,
what did you expect me to do...

257
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:09,266

and allow you to murder us?

That I wouldn't take measures,
extreme measures to defend myself?

259
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,230
Wrong.

260
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,066
Think again.

...you have no one
to make your product.

266
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,922
Certainly not him.

267

This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

268

Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic
or aprotic? Because I forget.

If our reduction isn't stereospecific
how can our product be pure?

I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy-
2-methylamino-propane...

...containing, of course,
chiral centers...

00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,989
I never use this stuff.
Are you sure it'll do the job?

329)
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,408
Trust us.

330
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,166
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

331
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,168

No, I'm good. Thanks.

332
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,323
How you doing?

333
O0s41<35,535 ==> 003418 87,120
No, I mean, you know...

334
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,582
...how are you doing?

335
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,092
You did the only thing

that you could.

 

 

336
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,261
I hope you understand that.

337
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,433
Thoughts?

338
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:06,065
Any thoughts
on what our next move might be?

33:9
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,276
What next move?

340
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,153
Our next move.

341
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:16,617
Our next move, given the fact that at
the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.

342
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,871
What, that wasn't an opportunity
just now?

343
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,415
Seemed like a damn good opportunity
to me.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

344
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,876
-No, no.
-Golden, I would say.

345
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,671
We bought ourselves some time,
Yes, Bute oes

346
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,634
The question is how much.
He'll be looking for another chemist.

347
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,637
He's not gonna find another chemist.

348
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39, 348
Where is he gonna find
another chemist?

349
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,561
It's not just about somebody
being able to run a lab that big.

350
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,188
Someone he can trust...

351
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,233
...someone he knows
will keep their mouths shut.

352
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,987
Yeah. Good luck with that.

353
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,201
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

354
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00, 953
Bet he's sorry now.

355
00243210,129 => 002439213,549
-Are you sure you're okay?

-Now we all understand each other.

356
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,343
Right?

357
00243216,135 ==> 00:43:21,015
-What do you mean?
-I mean, him and us, we get it.

358
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,733
We're all on the same page.

359
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,447
And what page is that?

360
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,908
The one that says:

361
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41, 369
"If I can't kill you...

362
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,330
..you'll sure as shit wish
you were dead."

363
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,219
Yo, excuse me.

364
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,722
Thanks.

365
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18, 614
~Here:
-Thank you, sir. Have a good one.

366
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,449
Thanks.

i
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:08,634
So how's it look?

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,970
Meaning, do I see it?

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14, 348
Yess

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,059
Do you see it?

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:24, 483
Basically, any lawman worth his salt
is gonna spot that, yeah.

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,486
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,405
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:37,120
Well, if stealth
is what you're aspiring to...

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,792
...you best go
with something more compact.

0
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,710
Thirty-eight Special.

1
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44, 920
Snub nose.

2
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,755
Got a concealed hammer...

 

3
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,591
...So it don't catch on your belt
when you draw.

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,886
Tried and true.
No nonsense about it.

15)
002003 55,305 ==> 00:00: 56,723
-Five shots.
~Yeah.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,725
Automatic has how many?

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,103
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,648
If you can't get it done with five,
you're into spray and pray...

19
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,860
..in which case, I wouldn't count
on another six closing the deal.

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,863
You load that
with 158-grain hollow points...

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,993
..instead of standard wadcutters,
it's got plenty of stopping power.

22
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,705
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,085
Try it on with this.

24
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,011
That snubbie will conceal up real nice
if you carry it IWB.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
25
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,264
Little harder to draw from,
but there's no substitute...

26
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,267
...-if you're intent
on fooling a vigilant eye.

27
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,020
Comes in polymer too.

28
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,731
I prefer the feel of leather.

29
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48, 400
Old school, I guess.

30
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,655
Sure it's on the correct side?

31
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,616
If you're right-handed, it is.

32
00201 355,907 === 00201258, 201
I don't know, ma-- Are you sure?

 

33

00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,163
Maybe it'll feel better

on the left side.

 

34
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,749
General rule,
you don't wanna cross-draw.

35
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,251
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.

36
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,047
You know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

37

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:23,143
Either way, you're gonna wanna
practice your draw. A lot.

38
00202 :.23,310 => 00:02:25,562
Because if you're all fingers...

39
002022257729 --> 00:02:29,232
..well, it might could be him
keeping the peace instead of you.

40
00#022.25,399 =<» 00:02231,026
Catch my drift?

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,781
What's this?

42
00202: 36,365 => 00:02:38,825
That is why you're gonna pay me
five times...

43
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,745
...-what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

44
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,458
Serial number's been filed off.

45
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,505
So to state the obvious...

46
00:02:51,672 --> 00702: 54,591
...I don't wanna be caught with this
on me.

47
00702:55,092 --> 00:02:57,176
No. To state the obvious, you don't.

48
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,891
You know, mister, I've been providing
my services for the past 30-odd years.

49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,520
Think I'd learn better
than to ask a man his business...

50
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,106
...especially not one referred
by the lawyer.

51
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,316
But I do feel the urge to ask you...

52
00#03212,150 -—> 00:03214, 903
...are we strictly talking defense
here?

53
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,907
Yes, absolutely.

54
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,117
Defense.

55
00203220,283 --> 00:03:21,785
Why?

56
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,747
Because
if it's just personal protection...

57
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28, 667
...aside from a bucket of money...

58
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,504
...you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot...

59
002032 32,671. => 00:03: 36,967
...for carrying a weapon with a defaced
serial number if you buy it legally.

60
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:43,014
But if you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better to use one...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
61
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,683
...that couldn't be traced?

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,268
This is the West, boss.

63
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,896
New Mexico's
not a retreat jurisdiction.

64
00703:50,063 =--> 00:03:52,357
Man steps to you bent
on doing you harm...

65
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,528
...you got every right to plant your feet
and shoot to kill.

66
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:01,450
Some call it a moral right, and I do
include myself within that class.

67
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,079
All this to say,
I'm happy to take your money.

68
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,583
But if you're not a convicted felon...

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,711
-..-you might best be advised
to bear your arms...

70
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,589
..within the confines of the law.

71
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,305
It's for defense.

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,480
Defense.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
73
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,990
I'll take it.

74
00205: 35,377 ==> 00:05: 37,379
Thanks, Bonnie.

75
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,730
Jesse.

76
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,690
What's up, brother?

77
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,361
Dude, sounds like an earthquake
out there.

78
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,196
New sound system.

719
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,574
-Check it out.
-Bodacious subwoofers, yo.

80
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,326
Serious cannons.

81
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,745
Eighteen-inchers, six of them.

82
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,666
Aluminum cones, so they're
really, really, like, sonically neutral.

83
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,209
Tweeters are killer too.

84
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,754
Dig all them lines jumping around.
Psychedelic.

85
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,095

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Kind of like just wanna stare
at them.

86
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:56,142
Yeah, man, totally makes me wanna
crank old Sabbath and blaze one.

87
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58, 687
It's got, like, parametric equalization.

88
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,941
Automatically adjusts the levels to
changes in air pressure and whatnot.

89
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,026
It's totally digital.

90
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08, 947
Vacuum tube amp, which is by far
the best, anti-distortion-wise.

91
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,450
Hits 120 decibels
without breaking a sweat.

92
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,161
Hold onto your hats, bitches.

93
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,726
Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting
yesterday.

94
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,103
She asked about you.

25:
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,165
Thanks, man,
but 12 steps and all that.

96
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,625
Seriously?

97

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,106
Maybe just a little bump.

98
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,995
"Left 4 Dead." Bitches get all cranial
when you cap them in the head, like:

99
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,458
No, no, no, man. "Resident Evil 4"
takes it by a long shot.

100
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,461
-Please, brother. You're fronting.
-No, seriously.

101
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,923
That chick, the one you gotta rescue?
She's smoking, bro.

102
00709:50,090 =--> 00:09:53,301
And then you're, like,
the last undead dude on earth.

103
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,470
How can you not be dipping
into that?

104
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,348
Talk about inspiring a brother

They're not just zombies,

Nazi zombies.

Dude,
you are so historically retarded.

Nazi zombies don't wanna eat you just
because they're craving the protein.

117

They do it because--

118
OO#1L08 37,971. <> 00s108 42,016
They do it
because they hate Americans, man.

119

Oh, yo, about time. Oh, my God.

Yo, what's up with the pie, man?
It ain't cut.

-What gimmick?

This place, they don't cut their pizza,
they pass the savings on to you.

276

How much can it be
to cut a damn pizza?

277
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,180
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.

278
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,683
You know, cut your own
Christmas tree, cut your own pizza.

279

One of them shot in the head.
Same night, I get this in my mailbox.

You know what?

looking for this?

No.

of stopping you.

Yes, Hank.

I don't know. Three, four hundred.

-No, they're minerals.

Jesus, Marie. I got some geodes
coming that are very delicate, all right?

I'll not accept any boxes
that have damage.

ass-raped by those bastards.

-I do.

And I am prepared to talk numbers
right now, if you'd like.

351

You think this is an easy job?

352
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,670
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees...

353
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09, 673
...and scrub like a housemaid...

354

Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

357
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,227
Any other advice for me?
Because I am serious about this.

358
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,687
Good.

359
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,022
I am serious too.

360
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:30,277
I have worked 30 years on building
this business from nothing...

...with my own hands
and my own sweat and blood.

362

I can appreciate that. Truly.

363
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,201
So with that in mind...

364
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,912
..is there a figure you can quote me?

365

number? You pull it from your behind?

On a typical day,
you average 19 cars per hour.

Extrapolating, I added the extra
revenues for hand waxes and detailing.

371
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,738
Subtracted your overhead in salary...

operating fees, depreciation...

..-giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here.

375
00235325,123 == 002353 29,794
I applied the industry-standard multiplier,
added market value of your real estate.

376
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,674
Giving me a total estimated value
of $829,000.

377

an extra $50,000.

He quit without giving me notice.

386

He broke my air fresheners,
he cursed at me, and grabbed himself.

387

And now he wants
to buy my car wash.

388
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16, 633
But he's not man enough
to come in here and face me himself.

cash settlement that I can win for you...

00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,761
You and I...

439
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,512
..we're in the same boat.

440
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,931
Drink your drink.

441
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,184
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

442
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,020
And what the hell was that, anyway?

443
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,855
A message?

444
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,150
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

445
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,402
You won, Walter.

446
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,988
You got the job.

447
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:54,077
Do yourself a favor
and learn to take yes for an answer.

448
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,579
Yeah, I got the job.

449
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,331
But for how long?

450
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,089
Get me in a room with him.
451
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,885
Mike, just get me in a room...

452
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,596
.-and. I'll do the rest.

453
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,230
You done?

454
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,194
Yeah.

 

 

455
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,772
Thanks for the drink.

456
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21, 664
Pinkman, man,
you know how to party, brother.

457
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,333
Epic. Epic.

458
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,211
Seriously? Where you two going?

459
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,340
Jesse, I've been awake
for, like, three straight days.

460
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,384
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

461
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,844
So crash here.

462
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,055
It's not like I ain't got the space.

463
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,434
Yeah, that's cool and all,
but I think I got, like, this cat.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
464
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,438
Think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.

465
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,982
Whatever, you little bitch.
What about you?

466
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,652
You sticking or do I gotta flip you over,
check you for a slizz?

467
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,363
Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here,
yo.

468
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,450
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

469
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,204
Hell, brother,
you know we got mad love for you.

470
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,792
Now that you're back in the mix,
it's, like, nothing but good days ahead.

471
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,339
Plenty of time to pace it out,
is all I'm saying.

472
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,674
Yeah, man.

473
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,094
Totally.

474
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,932
I was thinking, like, next week?

475
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,893

I've left you, like, 23 messages.

8
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,254
-And?
-And?

9
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,341
We need to talk about the car wash.

10
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,094
Skyler,
now is not a good time for me, okay?

11
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,013
-Can we talk about this later?
-No, okay? We can't.

12
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,559
Why are you doing--?

13
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,020

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Oh, Jesus.

14
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,189
-What happened?
-Nothing. I just bumped it. That's all.

5
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,026
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.
6
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,326
Okay.
7

00203321,493 == 002033 24,371
Exactly what happened?

8

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,999
It's complicated

and I don't wish to discuss it.

 

9
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,210
-It's none of your concern.
-Are you in danger?

20
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,839
Walt.

21
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,594
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me right now.

22
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,139
-Are you in danger?
-You know what?

23
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,104
Let's just say that I have a hell
of a lot more on my mind right now...

24
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,232
...than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

25

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,525
Okay?

26
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,694
So if you could just--

27
002034 55,861, ==> 00203: 5%y779
Please.

28
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,742
Okay.

29
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,996
Okay. Then we go to the police.

30
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,875
-What?
-We tell them everything.

31
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,295
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety...

32
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,673
..and the safety of your family
and you need help.

33
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,217
-What choice is there?
-What choice?

34
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,720
If you're in danger then it would be--

35
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,181
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.

36
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,975
You keep saying that word.
“Danger...” “Danger, ™

37
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,811

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-But you said--
-No, I have never used that word.

38
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,939
I said "complicated"
and then you flew off the handle.

39
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,193
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that.

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,154
Okay? Where'd that come from?

41
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,115
A fall in the shower?

42
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,161
This is just so passive-aggressive,
you know.

43
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,454
Passive-aggressive?

44
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,249
I go two days without returning
your phone calls, two days...

45
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,754
...and I have one minor little incident,
and now you're telling me...

46
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,590
...that I should turn myself
in to the police!

47
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,008
-A minor incident?
“Yes.

48
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,094
What minor little incident?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
49
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:09,267
I had an argument with a coworker,
okay?

50
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,020
And?

51
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,939
I had an argument.

52
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,024
We were in this bar...

53
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,361
...and we were discussing
a particular business strategy.

 

 

54
00205719,528 ==> 00:05:25,575
And it got heated and out of control,
and he hit me. Once.

55
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,912
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

56
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,289
And that's it.

57
00v05133,792 => 0005: 36,294
You were in a bar fight?

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,135
Yes, Skyler. I was in a bar fight.

59
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,764
So you're okay?

60
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,309
Really?

61
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,481

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Yess

62
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,441
I'm okay.
63

00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,405
And I think, in the end,
that it may have been a good thing...

64
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,741
...because we were able to clear the air
and, you know....

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,952
Mutual respect, and....

66
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,454
SOw «ss

67
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,499
Frozen peas.

68
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,421
-What?
-It's the best thing for the swelling.

69
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,133
Oh, it's not really swollen, it's just--

70
00206:23,300 ==> 00:06:25,176
No peas.

71
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,345
You don't even have ice.

12
00806127, 512 s=> 002068 31,683
I will get peas, I will get ice.
Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.

I need you to promise me...

25)
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,154

-that if things do get dangerous--—

76
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,907
-Skyler--
-Promise me.

77
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,326
Absolutely.

78
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,246
So....

79
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,625
Car wash.

80
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,767
Honey. Charles.

81
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,563
Take a look at this kitchen.

82
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,903
Hi there.
Can I answer any questions?

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,572
Yes. Any chance of a top-off?

84
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,493
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

85
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,585
So, what do you think?

86
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43, 880
Oh, very nice. Very open.

87
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,341
Oh, I agree. It flows.

88
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,760
Whole lot of natural light.

89
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,220
Michael Kilbourne.

90
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,014
-Tori Costner.
-It's nice to meet you.

91
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,018
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half
baths on just under half an acre.

92
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59, 980
There's a non-attached casita
out in back.

93
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,692
Permit usable as office
or guest suite.

94
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,318
Plank wood floors.

95
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,945
Central heat and air.

96
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,239
I see you're married.

97
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,074
No, divorced.

98
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,575
Very recent.

99
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,703
-Old habits.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,331
-But any children?
-Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.

101
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, how old?

102
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,378
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini.
Would love this yard.

03
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,588
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.

04

00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,550

And the neighborhood preschool
is fantastic.

 

05
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,094
I think Eli is going to be
homeschooled.

106
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,471
-Well, great.
-Not for religious reasons.

107
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,057
I wanna make sure
he's getting attention.

108
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,144
He'll still go to summer camp
and whatnot, playdates.

109
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,605
-Don't want him to be socially awkward.
-Makes sense.

110
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,775

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

He tests very highly, 96 percentile.

111
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,071
But that whole right brain, left brain.
You want those in balance.

112
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,364
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,244
You said the casita has plumbing?

114
00:08:56,411 --> 00:09:00,415
I work a lot with clay,
so I need access to running water.

5
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,585
Well, it's pipe-fitted
for a quarter bath so....

116
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,171
Make a perfect studio.

117
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,468
This could work.

118
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,764
Hell, that's the doctor's plan
to get her patients at ease.

19
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,099
If you know what I mean.

20
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,601
But, nurse--

 

21
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,728
Hello? I'm back.

And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

 

288

What a fascinating career
that must have been for him.

289
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,074
It was.

290
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,869
I mean,
NASA was like a second family to us...

291
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,915
...but, you know,
it was time for a new adventure.

When were these floors redone?

294

Two years ago.
The counters are brand-new.

295

I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

My husband is an illustrator. We
traveled a lot. Paris, Italy, Denmark.

313

It was before the kids were in school,
so it was easy to pick up and go.

314
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,416
That was before my youngest, Lucy,
was diagnosed with endocarditis.

You want my help on a case?

453
00733225,921 =-> 00:33:27,255
What am I, Ironside?

454
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,133
No, you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent.

455
002332 30,300 ==> 00:33:33,970
And a pal I just did a favor for,
so let me pick your brain a sec.

456
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,891
You ever come across a guy
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

457
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39, 684
No.

458
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,771
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

459
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46, 358
-Okay.
-No signs of forced entry...

460
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,026
..-no signs of robbery.

461
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:52,614
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?

462
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,992
We found a notebook at his place.

463
002332 56,159 —-> 00733258, 995
I made a copy for you,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

in case you're interested.

464
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:04,209
Looks like it pertains to some kind
of methamphetamine superlab.

465
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,460
Yeah.

466
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:10,131
It's filled with scientific formulas
and chemical purchase lists...

467
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,385
...drawings,
pages and pages of this stuff.

468
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:18,515
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority,
so I wonder if you might take a look?

469
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,769
Come on, Tim, seriously?

470
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,189
What is this,
some sort of a charity thing?

471
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,400
Your expertise could be useful here.

472
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,570
I'm lying here like third base...

473
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,322
...living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

474
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,992
I'm not even useful to myself.

DEA case,

Want my advice?

476
00:34:40,412 -->
You take this to

00:34:42,914 -->

00:34:42,747
steve Gomez.

00:34:46,042

-He'll help you out.
-I give this to Steve Gomez...

478
00:34:46,209 -->

479

00:34:51,381 -->

If you could just take a look,

tell me what I

480

00:34:56,636 -->

00:34:50,171

00:34:56, 344

got here.

00:34:58, 680

I'd really appreciate it.
481
00:35:01,933 -->. 00:35:03,268
Yeah.
482
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06, 980
Whatever.
483
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,027
Thanks, man.
484
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,029
Take it easy.
485
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,573
That's what I do.
486
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,221
-No, no.
three, seven, nine. He says,
487
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00, 659
Well, it was a good try.

...and all of a sudden it becomes a
what good does that do me?

"No."
488
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,042

Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

489
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11, 628
Okay.

490
00236215, 757 --> 00:36:17,509
So....

491
00236:18,635 =—> 00:36:22,555
Nail salon sounded promising.
What do you think?

492
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,432
I think we wait.

493
00#36:24,599 => 00:36:26,101
Wait?

494
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29, 938

Skyler, it has been five hours.

495
00236:30,105 =—> 00:36: 31, 648
He'll call.
496

00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,109
-Just wait.
-Just wait.

497
002363 34,275 ==> 0023.6: 35, 652
Look....

498
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,865
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea, but it didn't

499
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44, 661
So why don't we simply chalk it
as a learning--

White residence.

501
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,173
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

502
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,009
Am I still interested?

503
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,846
Well, I think that depends.

504
00237703,012 ==> 00:37:07,976
Yes, 879 was the original offer,
but that seems high to me now.

505
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,437
-Now I'm offering 800.
-No, no, no.

506
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,063
-No, don't do that.
-Why?

507
00237:12,230 --> 00:37:15, 692
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.

508
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,570
You were rude,
disrespectful towards my husband.

509
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,865
Furthermore, I've met
with quite a number of sellers...

510
00237222,031 ——> 00:37226,578
...and the market seems much softer
than I thought, so 800.

511
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:35, 628
Well, I understand that you're
disappointed, but that is my final offer.

00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,008
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
Goodbye.

513
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,428
What are you doing?

514
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,513
I'm negotiating.

SLB
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,265
Why?

516
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,933
Because I want to pay less.

517
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,643
Oh, no.

518
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,271
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?

 

519)
00237:53,438 => 00:37:55, 60.7
Who cares?
Do you know how much I make?

520
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah, but that's the very reason
we need to negotiate.

621
00237259,027' --> 00:38:02,572
We don't wanna arouse suspicion
by not trying to get a good deal.

522
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:07,285
Look, I get the logic, I do,
but you just went too far with it.

523
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,828

You're calling him names?

524

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00238:08,995 ==—> 00:38:12,499
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.

B25)
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,588
Well, he's not calling you back.

526
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,926
I mean,
you didn't honestly think that worked?

527
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,721
Yeah, I do.

528
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,766
No way. Sorry. No.

529
00738:29,933 --> 00:38:33,269
So look, it's time to move on.

530
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,231
Okay? I'm gonna call Saul.

531
00238:36,523 => 00:38:38, 650
Where's my phone?

532
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,796
-No.
-What?

533
00938459,963 === 00%39301,381
-No, just--
-What for?

00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,217
Wait. Wait.

Oh, my God.

Hello.

537
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,854
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

538
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,982
No one's paying attention
to where these things are.

539
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:23,695
There's gotta be thousands of them
all over the world coming right for us.

540
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,866
And put one inside an ice cream truck,
drive it into San Francisco.

541
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,077
I'm not even that scared
of burning up and cannibalism.

542
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:34,455
To me, the thing that worries me
is getting trampled...

543
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,083
...or shoved up
against a chain-link fence.

544
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40, 628
If you think about it,
if you're against a chain-link fence...

545
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:45,258
»..and you've got a lot, I mean,
a lot of people trying to escape...

546
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,886
...pushing hard enough forward...

547
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,723
...you are gonna get squeezed
right through the chain links.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
And

548
00239251,890 --> 00:39:55,435
Like Play-Doh
or some kind of soft meat.

549
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,478
And this is inevitable, okay?

550
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00, 982
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

551
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04, 986
if the fence posts are stuck deep,
really deep with the cement...

552
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,905

...-way down inside the ground...

553
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,115

-it's definitely happening to you.

554
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,161
-Oh, yeah.

-Yeah, bitch.

555
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,581
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

556
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,044
Like soft meat, man.

557
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,798
Right through.

Squeezed through there like soft meat.

Money!

562
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,326
That one was mine.

563
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,204
-Take it easy!
-Hey, you took mine, man!

564
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,997
Yeah!

00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,064
-Nice.
~Yeah.

566
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:34,325
To clean cars and clean money.

Hear, hear.

568
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44, 460
You see?

569
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,462
I told you we'd get it.

570
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,297
Did you?

S71
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,137
Seriously.

572
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,056
It was really great work.
573
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,017
It's impressive.

574
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,644
Thank you.

57S
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,523
And Saul finally came through.

576
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,193
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

577
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:14,282
Well, yes, he found the guy, but
I told him what to do and what to say.

578
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,285
You're right. That's the hard part.

519
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,749
But, yes, Saul was finally useful.

580
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,917
Throw him a bone.

581
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,256
Oh, my God.

582
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,468
-This is truly amazing.
-Yes, well, it better be.

583
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,845
Three hundred twenty dollars

"Cuvée Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchill."

586
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,061
Apparently,
it was his favorite champagne...

587
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,480
-so they just named it after him.

588
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,983
-How did you pay for it?
-What do you mean?

589
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,861
No. Cash, I paid cash.

590
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,656
No, I'm asking how did you,
Walter White...

591
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,201
...an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

592
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00, 328
-How do you explain it?
-Skyler.

593
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,122
No one saw me.

594
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,832
Whoever sold it to you did.

595
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,878
And that's not the point.
The point is we're broke, remember?

596
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:13,007
I'm waiting for your unemployment

00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,052
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

598
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:20,681
-Because on paper, we have no money.
-You are completely overreacting.

599
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,977
I'm not apologizing for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

600
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,396
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.

I'm asking you to be smart.

602
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,360
I bought one bottle of champagne.

603
00243:32,527 =-> 00:43:35, 696
One single bottle, Skyler.

604
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,074
I paid cash. That's it.

605
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,119
That's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.

606
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,204
One piece of duct tape on a door...

607
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,207
...brought down
the president of the United States.

00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,502
...whether it's from
any sort of signage...

617
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,173
..but especially signage that's
changing every five seconds.

618
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,924
Thank you.

619
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,844
Any other questions?

620
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,848
We have a motion and a second

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
on the floor to grant the appeal.

621
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,685
All those in favor, raise your hand
and say yes. Yes.

622
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,687
There's four in the affirmative.
Those opposed?

623
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:55,276
There's five no's and the--
That motion fails.

624
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,654
I would like to make a motion
to uphold the decision...

625
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,241
...and the findings of the EBC.

626
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,287
And the motion, then, is seconded
by Councilor Cook. Any questions?

627
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:11,876
I see none. All those in favor, signify
by saying "yes" to deny the appeal.

628
00245: 16,756 <> 00345219, 258
All those in favor,
signify by saying "yes."

629
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,678
There's five in the affirmative
All those opposed, say "no."

630
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,598
There's four in the negative.
Now, that passes.

00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,402
You want me to open the doors?

2
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,949
Here. The keys. Take them.

3
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,327
Why you talking

~~

4
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,498
No! No, no, no--

 

 

5
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,850
Gambling destroyed my life.

6
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,730
Me, my family, everything I loved.

7
00:2:05:13;939 =-> 00:05:17, 943
It was like a robbery,
only I was the thief.

8
00805: 18,151. => 00:05:22,030
It's amazing the stories you tell
yourself to justify it.

9
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:28,829
The lies that lead you

to just one more hand, one more spin...

10
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,957
-one more roll of the dice.

11
00205:32,374 =-—> 00:05:36,795
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.

12
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,464
You guys are not lifting a finger.
I mean it.

13
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:44,427

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Yeah, we're bringing everything. So--
This is not up for debate, okay?

14
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,179
Great.

15)
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:50,058
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not
gonna say one word about the bills.

16
00:05:50,225 =-> 00:05:52,477
We just wanna bring everyone
up to speed.

17
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,605
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

18
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,487
So...

19
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,992
Tonight's the night. No turning back.

20
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,995
Well....

21
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,164
Okay. Let's do this.

22
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,627
Okay. So first, I assign point values.

23
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,130
Correlate to the effect of removal.

24
00206:20,338 ==> 003063 23,717
-You're gonna split the eights?
-Skyler, please.

25
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:28,471
Now, the mathematical principle
known as the Kelly Criterion...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
26
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,849
..-upon which I devised
my own strategy--

27
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,059
Not dissimilar to the MIT system--

28
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,604
Walt, you're not teaching them.

29
00%06:35,812 ==> 002063 39,,232
-You wanted me to be thorough.
-Play. You're taking too long.

30
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,986
You don't think it behooves me
to be able to explain any of this?

31
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,782
It behooves you to be a pro, that's all.
That's the fiction. So, chop-chop.

32
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,659
Don't chop-chop me.

33
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,580
Now, we both know
that the first decision...

34
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,708
...is whether or not to split
or to surrender.

35
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,085
On eights. Split them.

36
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,172
Good on both.

37
00:07:02,380 =-> 00:07:05,175
Next decision is whether

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
to double down or not.

38
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,595
-Which you should be doing.
-On an 11, yes. Double.

39
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,098
Okay, this hand over here,
we have a soft 18.

40
00:07:12,265 =-> 00:07:16,561
The final decision is whether or not
to hit or to stand. Hit it.

41
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,273
-Becomes a hard 15.
-Dealer has a nine.

42
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
I see that.

43
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23, 902
Hit it.

44
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,864
Okay, let's see what I got.

45
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,451
And 21.

46
00207:31,660 ==—> 00707232, 869
-Damn.
~Yup’.

47
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:38,041
Okay, the key thing to remember here
is that it's not about any one hand.

48
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,461
The key is the number of hands
per hour.

49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,797
Let's go again.

50
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:49,052
Zero, minus one, 0.6.

51
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,471
Okay.

52
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,017
-Walt.
-It's not as if I don't know how to play.

53
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,562
I certainly more than understand
how to count cards.

54
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,064
Let's just keep going.

55
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,150
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery, remember?

56
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,194
I shouldn't even be playing.

57
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,281
And that is the fiction
that we should be sticking to.

58
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,075
You know what?

59
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,372
You're right. Yeah.

60

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,627
Okay.

We're not leaving anything to chance.

 

61
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:27,257

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
All right. Let's get started.
Got a lot of....

62
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:32,220
-Walt. We got a lot of ground to cover.
-What is this?

63
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:36,057
We have to get our story straight.
We've gotta be on the same page.

64
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,018
-A script?

-Bullet points.

65
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,146
Bullet points? We got a novella.

66
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,692
This is smart. You really wanna try
to sell a DEA agent some...

67
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,403
.s.Eull-of-holes story
about how we suddenly...

68
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,655
...have enough money
to buy a car wash?

69
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,742
-Am I supposed to memorize this?
-We need to practice.

70
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,286
-We need to be word-perfect.
-Within reason.

vial
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,288
We need this story to be solid...

72
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,750
...and sympathetic

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
and, most of all, completely believable.

73
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,044
The story that you already told Marie.

74
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,379
You think that she hasn't told Hank?

75
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,174
Come on, this is Marie
we're talking about here.

76
002093 09,382 ==> 00709% 12, 635
No, she hasn't. She hasn't.

77
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,555
Hank thinks his insurance is paying
for everything.

78
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,808
Marie's not telling him
we are paying his therapy bills.

719
00209:18,975 =-> 00:09:21,352
-And neither are we.
-And why is that again?

80
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,690
-Really?
-If we have the gambling story...?

81
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,571
Did you take money, Walt?
You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

82
002092 31,738 => 00:09: 35,075
I seem to recall that
you'd rather sell drugs than take help.

83
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,036
-Fine.
-Marie will tell Hank in her own time.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
84
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,580
And at least we'll have laid
the groundwork.

85
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,708
And coming clean with Hank
and Juni--

86
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:51,174
Appearing to come clean
will be the best thing for everyone.

87
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,759
We talked about this.

88
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,555
-Okay? We agreed about this.
-Yes, we did. It's just....

89
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,849
What?

90
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02, 602
Never mind. Just--

91
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,900
Okay. So I really think we should
tag team the narrative, okay?

92
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:14,114
We'll each be responsible for certain
portions of the story and then we can--

93
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,409
We can hand off so we don't leave
anything out, and it'll seem natural.

94
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,579
Okay. So I'm gonna launch
with the exciting news...

95
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,458

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...that we are buying a car wash.

96
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,129
The next logical question
Hank will probably ask is:

97
00210¢29,295 == 00210: 32,715
"Where are you getting the money?"
To which I'll say:

98
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,844
We wanna tell you the whole story.
It's a doozy...

99
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,139
..Sso hold onto your hats.

100
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,599
Do you like that?

101
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,519
sure.

102
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,107

It accomplishes two things. It keeps

it light while letting them know...

 

 

103
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,568
...to expect something big.

104
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,446
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

105
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,118
Okay. Anyway, that's where you will
take over, starting with your diagnosis.

106
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,662
Pages one and two. Okay. And it's--

107
OO#11L: 02,871. ——> 00s112 06,875
It's pretty much gonna run parallel

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

to the truth,

00:11:07, 667

to

00:1

which makes it easier.

108

--> 00:11:10,086
But just make sure
really hit the cancer.

109
210,253 --> 00:11:12,380

Really touch on the fear and despair.

deceit,

111
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,636
We want them to understand why
you could do something so stupid.

 

112
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:25,185
Now, after that, per pages three
and four, after you say:

113
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,771
"Gambling became an addiction
and I just couldn't control it."

4
00211 328,938 ==~ 0011230,398
-Do you see that?
-Yes.

5
OOeLL: 30,607 = 00s.11231,858
In the middle. Okay.

 

 

6

00:11:32,066 -->
I put in that line
from the GA meeting.

00:11:36,029
about robbery,
That was good.

117
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,033
So next, I'll chime in about how
it affected our marriage...

118
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,495
...Starting with the confusion, the
why we couldn't tell anyone--
119
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,916
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed
of my actions.

120
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,376
-Yeah.
-Two "terribly"s?

121
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,005
-It's to show contrition.
-Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

122
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,050
I would never say
the word "terribly."

12:3:
OO#LL: 57,258 <> 00s.12201,012
Phrase it however you want. Okay?
You're jumping ahead. Now--

124
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,515
And why--?

And why am I so ashamed?

125
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,685
Do I really need to answer that?

126
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,816
I was, and am,
providing for our family.

127
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,490
-Let's just pick up where we left off.
-I'm weak, I'm out of control.

128
00%12:20,657 => 00212322,242
This makes me look like crap.

129
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,078
This has to be a warts-and-all story.

130

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
O0FT2 $25,286 == 0OS1T25 27,872
That's how we'll sell it.
We both look bad.

131
00212:28,039 =-> 00:12:29,832
How do you look bad exactly?

132
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,919
Where is the "I slept with my boss"
bullet point?

133
00812: 33,127 “a 00122 35,129.
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

134
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,633
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth...

135
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,344
...-I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

136
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,889
I don't like it.
I don't want Junior thinking less of me.

13°7

00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:50,103
At least you won at gambling. I'm the
bitch mom who wouldn't cut you slack.

138
O08127457,818 ==> 003128 58,987
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,949
I'm sorry
that I put you through all of this.

 

140
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,454
How's that sound?

141
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,628
Two "sorry"S.

142
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,632
I believe we were on page five.

143
00213: 19,841. =-> 00:13:25,263
So after you say how very sorry you
are, in your own words, of course...

144
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,931
..we're almost to the end.

145
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,311
And then I say how proud I am of you
for joining a 12-step program.

146
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:37,108
And this is where I think we should
enact how we're feeling, you know?

147
002133 37,275 == 002133 44,082
Just a suggestion. You might
look down at the floor with remorse.

 

148
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,829
What? You don't have to mean it.

149
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53, 624
You just stare down at your feet,
Walt, okay?

150
00213253,791 =-> 00:13:55,877
Then I'm gonna....

151
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:01, 341
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand
and saying something emotional like:

152
00:14:01,507 =-> 00214203, 259
It's such a relief to tell you.

153
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,262
We're glad we have a strong family
to help us.

00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:12,060
That we can all support each other.
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

155
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,730
I don't know. We'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

156
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,108
You're gonna cry on cue?

157
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,320
-I said, I don't know. Maybe.
-When you dab your eyes...

158
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,365
...you gonna do it
with your right hand or your left?

59

00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,743

-One tear? Two tears? How many?
-This has to be convincing.

60

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,038
Especially to Hank.

I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.

61
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,956
And yes, I'm thorough.

 

62
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,755
Maybe lying doesn't come
as easily to me as it does to you.

 

163
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,065
-Guys! Come on in! Hi!
-Hey.

-Great to see you.
-How you doing?

167
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,199
Look at my little princess.
She's getting big.

168

-Yeah. And heavy too.
-Is that actual food I'm smelling?

169
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13, 663
I might get an
honest-to-God meal here?

-Thank you, sweetheart.

-Hey, no. I-- I got it.

Come on, guys. It's down the hall here.

00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,822
Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
Okay? It's manganese inosilicate.

180
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,033
Cool. What makes it be
all pink like that?

181
00:15:51,242 -->. 00:15:55,329
Well, that's the manganese part. Okay?
It oxidizes, you know, like rust.

182
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57, 665
Manganese can have
an oxidation state...

183
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,168
...of between minus-three
and plus-seven...

184
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,921
..-which takes it through a range
of colors. Purple, green, blue.

185
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,884
But its most stable state is plus-two,
which is usually pale pink.

It's not a dead body?

If I recall, at least from the first
French Connection...

297
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,319
...-Popeye Doyle never actually
caught him.

298
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,825
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

299
00#24:53,117 =—“> 00224255,369
Day late and a dollar short.

300
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,629
-What about the person who killed him?
-A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.

301
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,548
-Any leads?
-My buddy Tim says...

302
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,467
...they got some fingerprints
they're trying to ID.

303
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,846
Eyewitness saw a person of interest.
Might get lucky there.

304
00225:14,013 --> 00:25:17, 641

Somebody knows something.
They'll track the shooter eventually.

305
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,644
Jesse.

306
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,632
Jesse.

307
002253 50,799 => 00:25:52,259
What's up?

308
00226:01,559 ==> 00:26:03,437
I need to talk to you.

309
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,230
Okay.

310
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,445
Now.

311
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,947
Go ahead.

312
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,454
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

 

313:
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,041
I'm not done, yo.
And that dude's next.

314
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,464
-What the hell? What is wrong--?
-We have business to discuss.

315
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,966
So discuss. Jesus.

316
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,551
Let go of me.

Gale's murder is being investigated.

318
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,477
And I have it on good authority that
they found fingerprints at the scene.

319
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,562
Not mine.

320
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49, 983
-We done here?
-No, we are not done here.

321
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,778
What if they are yours?
How can you be so sure?

322
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56, 698
Because I'm here. Your brother-in-law's
got such a hard-on for me...

323
00#26:56,865 => 00:26:59,118
..if the cops found my fingerprints--

324
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,746
If the cops found my prints
within five blocks of that place...

325
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,207
...they would've picked me up
by now.

326
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,543
What about the casing?

327
00227207, 709 ==> 00227209,753
-Oh, my God.
-Or casings?

328
00227:09,962 => 00327212, 798
How many times

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

did you shoot him, anyway?

329
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,886
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?

330
00227:18,262 =-> 00:27:20,597
Did you pick them up?

331
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,849
No.

332
00227:24,143 ==> 00:27:25,978
Yeah, well....

333
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:31,358
Listen, we gotta go over this
step-by-step, everything.

334
00227: 31,525 ==> 00227: 34,778
Tell me exactly what happened
from the moment you got there.

335
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,114
=I. got. in, I got. out.
-No.

336
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,034
No, I need to know specifics.
Now, we'll start from the beginning.

337
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:46,081
You drove there. You drove over there.
You went to his door, right?

338
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,751
Jesse, I need you to concentrate.

339
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,588
This is very important.
Did you knock or ring?

340
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,215

Knock or ring?

341
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,967
Knock.

342
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,387
Good, good. That's very good.
Now, listen.

343
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,057
Assume that Gale answered the door.
What happened after that?

344
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,601
Did he recognize you?

345
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,936
Did you say anything to each other?

346
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,065
Did you walk into the room or did you
shoot him right then and there?

347
00228:12,232 --> 00:28:13,567
What?

348
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,072
-Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
-Yeah.

 

349
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,216
Look, the kid's probably right.

350
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,178
If they had anything on him,
he'd be locked up already.

351
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,972
What about my brother-in-law?
He suspects Jess--—

352
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,685
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved
in the sale of blue meth.

353
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:54,066
That was Hank's one-and-only lead.
What if he puts two and two together...

354
00228254,233 --> 00:28:56,526
...and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

B55
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,863
Goes after him how,
on his Rascal scooter?

356
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,618
That perhaps sounded insensitive.

357
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,956
But if he goes after him,
I'll sue his ass for police brutality...

358
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,500
...harassment,
assault and 16 other things.

359
002 29311;,667 =--> 00329915,212
No, history those two have together,
being what it is...

360
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:19,675
..-gotta figure your brother-in-law's
smart enough not to go down that road.

361
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,720
Goose egg. Bubkes.
That's what the cops got.

362
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,014
I wouldn't worry about it.

363
00329:26,265 -—> 00:29:29,309
Yeah, what else should I

not worry about, Saul?

364
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,563
Should I not worry that Gus plans to
murder me at the first chance he gets?

365
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,443
That my drug-addicted partner doesn't
seem to care whether he lives or dies?

366
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,657
You should see his house.
It's like skid row.

367
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,827
He has actual hobos living there.

368
00229: 47,035 —“> 00:29:50,497
Now, how long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?

369
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:55, 669
Jeez, I got Mike,
that grunting, dead-eyed cretin...

370
00:29:55,877 --> 00:30:00,424
...sucker-punching me in the face.
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

371
002302 00,590 ==> 00:30705,387
I mean, Western Union,
message received.

372
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:12,561
Let me ask you.
When did this stop being a business?

373
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:17,649
Why am I the only person capable
of behaving in a professional manner?

374
00230:21,069 --—> 00:30:25,532
No, any way you slice it,

everyone is in danger.

375
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,328
I mean, how can I protect anyone?

376
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,205
My family, Jesse, myself?

377
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,002
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

378
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:43,258
And meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

319
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:48, 680
Oh, yeah.

That ship has sailed, bon voyage.

380
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,767
We are committed.
We already told our family about it.

381
002303 51,933 ==> 00730754,'895
And now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes--

382
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:59, 649
She needs to believe
that everything is neat and tidy.

383
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,737
And she's telling herself that

I work in this nice, quiet little lab...

384
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,615
...with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector...

385
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,327
...and when my contract is up,
I'll just simply hang it all up...

Oh, God.

388

How did everything

get so screwed up?

 

389
00831423,965 s=>' 002318 27,427
Yeah, you do have a little
shit-creek action happening.

390
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:40,148
You know, FYI,
you can buy a paddle.

391
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,445
This is a last-resort,
back-pocket kind of thing...

392
OO#31: 45,612 => 00312 50,283
...-but if you really gotta protect
yourself, disappear....

393
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,711
There's a guy who can make it happen.
They call him a "dissapearer."

394
00232202,295 --> 00:32:05,298
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial...

395
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,553
...you and your loved ones can vanish.
Untraceable.

396

Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

399
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,818
New identities, new everything.
No one would ever be able to trace you.

400
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,989
Now, be clear. This is an end game,
if you get my meaning.

401
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,575
I mean, there's no coming back.

402
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,832
So you want his card?

403
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,674
God, there's gotta be something else
that I can do.

404
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,220
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

405
00%32752,387 ==> 00232: 54,055
Well, from what you told me...

406
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,351
...it sounds like Pinkman is first up
in the imminent-demise department.

407
00233:01,354, ==—> 00933204,816
Gus won't risk
letting the police find Jesse.

I'm not kidding. If you really
think about it, you can't even see it.

410
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,181
How can you know how bad
radio frequencies, microwaves...

411
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,266
...and cell phones are getting you?

412
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,853
You could be strolling
through security at the airport--

413
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,480
Hey, wake up, bitches.

414
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,399
You get waved through a full-body
x-ray scanner.

415

Next day, you could be dead or dying
from all the radiation they say is safe.

416
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54, 908
But there's no way it could be.
It has to deliver a concentrated dose.

417
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56, 618
Enough to penetrate clothes.

 

418
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00, 664
The accumulated amount could be
dangerous to susceptible individuals...

I can do that. I can definitely do that.

Not a problem.
I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff.

But as far as the financial situation,
you know....

the concentrated doses...

marrow and it's gonna mess up....

Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?

457
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,271
-No.
-You sure, now?

458
00239316,437 ==> 007393 20,817
“ep.
-Don't even wanna take a wild guess?

459
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24, 988
You're gonna kill him.

460
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,909
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to beg you not to do it?

461
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,579
Oh, please, please.

462
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39: 34,581
And then what?

463
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm supposed to promise,
cross my heart...

464
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,004
..to straighten up and fly right
or toe the line...

465
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,673
...or some other crap
that I'm not gonna say?

466
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,051
Is that what your little show here
was all about?

467
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,557
You're on thin ice, you little shithead.
You know that?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
468
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,062
You ain't gonna smoke
that dude in there.

469
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,939
You know how come I know?

470
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:04,193
Because you went through the trouble
of putting a blindfold on him.

471
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10, 366
I'm going back to bed.

472
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,785
Let yourselves out.

473
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,215
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

474
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,887
-How's the ear?
-Mending.

475
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,771
What can I do for you?

476
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,606
It's Pinkman.

477
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,108
He's become increasingly incautious.

478
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47, 403
He's a risk. A liability.

479
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:52,075
I know he and Walter come as a team
and that Walter won't like it...

480
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,119

You'd better be ready in two minutes,
because am right outside your door.
485
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,265
Jesse.
486
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,394
Jesse!
487
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,483
Damn it.
488
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,615
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
489
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,159
Oh, great.

Jesse?

Jesse.

Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

497
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,872
Where is he?

498
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,978
Gonna ask where we're going?

499

00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,356
Nope.

You understand?

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,552
Tell me you understand, Saul!

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,556
Every dollar.
If you don't hear from me in 24 hours--

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:19,228
No, look. Shut-- Saul. Saul, shut up.
Shut up and listen to me.

I just wanted to say that I was thinking

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,916
Hello, would you like...

14
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,710
...to try our breakfast chicken chalupa
combo meal?

15
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,212
Gus Fring.

16
002022 50,420 => 00:02: 51,505
Excuse me?

17
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,717
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now.
Please.

18
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58, 637
-Mr. Fring isn't here right now. Is--?
-He's here.

19
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,223
His car is parked out front.
He's here.

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,933
He was here. Mr. Fring was--

21
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,104
You just go in the back and you tell him
it's Walter White. Understand?

22
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,650
He'll know what it's about.

23
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,405
I'll wait.

24
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,913
Yeah, let me get a chalupa special.

Walter,

00205:32,165 --> 00205: 33,208
Hello?

26
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,670

27
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,214
Where is Jesse?

28
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,550
Jesse's with me. He's fine.

29
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,802
What, do you expect me
to just believe that?

30
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm crossing my heart, Walter.

31
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49, 683
-Where is he?
-Hold on.

32
00205: 51,101. => 00:05:52,894
=X
-Jesse?

33
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,437
Yeah. What's up?

34
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58, 608
-Jesse, where are you?
-With Mike.

35
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,194
I know you're with Mike.

36
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03, 947
Are you all right?
Does he have a gun on you?

37
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,033

what exactly are you doing?
No.

38
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,870
What's going on, then?

39
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,706
-We're driving.
-Driving.

40
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,125
Driving where?

41
00206315,917 ==> 00:06:17,836
I don't know.

42
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,378
North.

43
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,886
Why is he driving you?
Where is he going?

44
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,846
Beats me.

45
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,016
I don't-- Put Mike back on.

46
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,021
Hello again.

47
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,441
Mike,
tell me now exactly what is going on.

48
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,692
Jesse's with me today.

49
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,321
So, what you need to do is go back
to your lab and get on with the cook.

50
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,115
You're gonna have
to muddle through this without him.

51
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,035
-That's what's going on.
-But it doesn't--

52
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,204
-Goodbye, Walter.
-Mike--

53
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,481
Sir.

54
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,525
Excuse me. Hey.
You're not allowed back there.

55
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,860
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,491
As I said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here.
This area is for employees only.

57
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,452
I have to ask
that you leave immediately.

58
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,313
What you told Mr. White, that's....

59
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04, 609
It's just bullshit, right?

60
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,464
What, you figure on just leaving me
in some ditch?

61
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,969
What do you care?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
62
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,805
I don't.

63
00208:35,557 =—> 00:08: 39,728
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight, old man...

64
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,565
-or I'll slice off your other ear
before this is over.

65
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,728
You coming?

66
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,777
We gotta do this six more times today
with a lot of miles in between.

67
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,988
I'd like to finish before dark.

68
00212:57,11L0 =-> 00:13:00,113
This freaking guy, I tell you what.

69
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,701
It's like Scarface had sex
with Mr. Rogers or something.

70
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,494
Who does this, you know?

71
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,080
Your boy Heisenberg,
thought we had him already.

72
002133 09,289 == 008135 11,124
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

73
O0e 13:3 LL.,.3832 => 00213: 13,710
Yeah, no.
Getz busted him a few months back.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
74
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,338
Yeah, well, no offense
to Detective Doogie Howser there...

75
008138617 ,547 S=> 003138 23,,720
..-but all he caught was a dipshit lifer
by the name of Jimmy In-'N-Out.

76
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,306
This one, he's your Heisenberg?

77
00213427,015 --—> 00713:28,516
Yeah, I believe he is.

78
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,061
So, what are you thinking? Rival
drug gang taking out the mastermind?

 

719
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,939
Any names I should check out?

80
0013:35,148 <-> 00:13:36,774
I wish I could help you there.

81
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,236
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

82
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,114
One is a beanie-wearing
jizz-stain...

83
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,701
...by the name of Brandon Mayhew,
street name "Badger."

84
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,454
Definitely not a player.

85
00813: 49,662 => 00s13: 51,581
And the other one...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
86
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,792
...is Jesse Pinkman.

87
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,129
He and I have a history.

88
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,922
Yeah.

89
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,258
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

90
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,053
That would surprise me.

91
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,432
Well, we have a composite

of a person of interest.

92

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,519

It's a guy the neighbors saw
at Boetticher's place...

 

 

53
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,772
...-right after the shooting.

94
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:21,194
-Yeah. Sorry.
-No, hang on to it, just in case.

95
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,946
We got a couple of prints
we're hoping to ID.

96
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,200
If I get any kind of hit,
I'll keep you in the loop on that.

97
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,701
You know...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
98
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,331
..-Tim, look,
I appreciate what you're doing, really...

29,
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,459
...you know,
keeping me involved and all...

100
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,798
-but, you know, finding this guy
Heisenberg dead like this...

O1
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,510
...-I have to say, it...

02
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,888
...kind of feels like closure to me.

03
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,975
Hank, you really are a big help here.

04
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,727
No, I know. I get it, really.

05
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,730
But I'm done.

06
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,046
You don't need to do that.

07
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,425
This is why I'm out here, right?

08
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09, 927
To be, like, your backup?

 

09
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,558
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity...

 

 

110
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:20,605

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...to watch over the money,
that means I need, like, a gun, right?

111
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,398
Nope.

112
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,417
I mean, isn't that, like, idiotic
for me to be out here without a gun?

113
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,045
You haven't said dick
about what I'm doing here.

114
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,172
Now I'm supposed to do it
without a gun?

5
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,841
How does that even make sense?

6
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,679
What? I can smoke, right?

7
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,849
Not a chance.

8
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,812
t's finally hitting me
what the plan is here.

 

 

9
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,107
It's to bore me to death...

 

20

00218:29,108 =-> 00:18:32,612
...SO mission accomplished

because it's totally working.

 

121
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,989
Great job.

122
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40, 620

You know,
I really do get what's going on...

123
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,749
..with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

124
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,546
Me and my boys had the exact same
system when I was running things.

125
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,173
My crew.

126
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,637
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging, but same theory.

27

00218:57,845 ==> 00:19:01,599
You know, maintain separation
between dealer and supplier...

28
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,851
...reduce risk...

29
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,354
.et cetera.

 

30
00219: 06,979 ==> 0019212, 652
Look, don't you think it'd be good if
there was some communication here?

131
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,946
You got me riding shotgun
to every dark anal recess in the state.

132
00819716,155 ==> 00:19:18,491
Be nice if you clued me in a little.

133
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,080
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?

134

00219%24,288 ==— 002193 27,249
And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy...

135
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,003
...then you should just tell me
what the hell is up.

136
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,469
-What?
-You are not the guy.

137
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,390
You're not capable of being the guy.
I had a guy, but now I don't.

38
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45, 685
You are not the guy.

39
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,188
-Then what the hell am I doing here?
-I don't know.

40
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51, 982
It's not my call. I just do what I'm told.

41
00219%52,191, =< 00719%55,-486
And now you're gonna do
what you're told, which is to sit here...

 

42
00219:55,695 --> 00:20:00,825
...shut up, and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups. You got it?

143
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57, 983
-We having second thoughts?
-Every hour of every day.

144
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,904
Let me tell you,
that is perfectly normal.

145
00222: 02,112 = 00722704,:073
But your expectations are realistic.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
146
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:08,202
You have a good, solid business plan.
I'm feeling very confident.

147
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,830
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

48
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,709
Walt?

49
00222 418,128 == 002223 19,839
Are you good?

50
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,925
Yeah.

51
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,139
All right.

 

52
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,944
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

53
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,071
Thank you very much, Alan.

54
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,574
It is my pleasure.

 

55
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,079
Mr. White.
56

00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,790
-Best of luck.
-Thank you.

157
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,503
I'm bringing the car over first thing

-Thank you again.
-You're welcome.

It's official.

62
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,104
How are you feeling?

00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22, 693
TMs sss
64

00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24, 862
Well, I'm-- How do you feel?

65
00223326,989 ==> 00923228, 949
Nervous.
66
00223:329,992 =-> 00:23:31, 952
Scared.
67

00:23:33,037 --> 00523:34,872
This is a big step, Walt.

68
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,166
If we don't do this right--

69
00233 37,374 --> 00323:38,/751
We'll be fine.

 

70
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,753
We will?
171
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,884
Tell me again.

172
00223:50,596 --> 00:23:55,309
We will be fine. Believe it.

173
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,357
If we're gonna do this,
I mean, really gonna do this...

174
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,401
...then we have
to promise each other...

175
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,570
..no more secrets.

176
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,951
There can't be any mistakes
like before.

77
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,954
There has to be complete honesty.

78
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm all for that.

79
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,542
Good.

80
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,212
Well, then...

81
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,881
-how about a drink to celebrate?

 

82
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,009
-Well--

-Well, we own a big-ass car wash now.

183

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,054
We do.
I guess that merits a celebration.

184
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,555
Nothing too expensive.

185
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,351
-Right. Right. Non-fancy liquor it is.
-Yes.

186
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,646
Just as long as it gets the job done.

187
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,237
It's me.

188
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:54,159
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and....

189
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,705
I love you.

190
00825420,477 == 002253 21,519
-Okay.
-Okay.

191
O0225:21,.729 ==> 0032.5: 25, 1.07
-Just take it off. Just take it off.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

192
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,679
The sheets,
they smell different than I remember.

193
00:25:56,346 =-> 00:25:57,973
Don't they?

194
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,895
New fabric softener.

195

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

002265 03,520 ==> 00226: 05,522
Yeah, I like it.

196
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:11,904
I also got a new haircut.

197
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,657
-Don't know if you--
-Oh, yes, I was gonna say something.

198
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,494
Were you, really?

199
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
I do like it.

200
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,168
Thanks.

201
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,923
So...

202
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,467
..-dinner tomorrow night?

203
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,387
I told Marie that we'd come over
and eat with them.

204
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,434
Think maybe you'll be free?

205
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,814
Yeah.

206
00%26:47,356 ==> 00:26: 51,235
Yeah, we can do that. That'll be nice.

207
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,946
Good.

208

Marie says it's about the only thing
that'll get Hank out of his room.

209
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,581
Mom?

210
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,844
-Hey, Mom? Dad?
-Hey, son.

211
00227220,013 => 00327222,.057
Where are you?

212
00:27:22,307 --> 00°327:25,894
We're back here.
We'll be out in a minute.

213
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,523
Oh, God.

214
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,113
-Seriously?
-I'm parked in the driveway.

215
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:41,118
This is going to make for some
very interesting dinner conversation.

216
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,540
He is definitely gonna ask
about our living situation now.

217
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,587
Maybe....

218
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,465
Maybe you should move back in.

219
00:27:55,673 --> 00:28:00,512
You know, just so it's easier
to explain to everyone.

You think?

221
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,916
I have to get back to work.

222
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,709
You know, schedule.

223
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,588
Yeah.

Damn it.

225

Hey!

226

can't do it alone.

'm done. That's it.

Jesse?

230
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,992
Where is Jesse?

231
00230327,200 ==> 007303 30,120
I need him.
You people have me down here...

232
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,874
...trying to complete

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

a two-man operation by myself.

233
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,211
It's unacceptable.
It's dangerous and counterproductive.

234
002308 39,921 ==> 007303 42,799
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.

235
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,969
That's one of the many, many things
he does around the lab...

236
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,472
...that keeps us on schedule,
so I suggest...

237
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,183
...-that you get him back
down here as soon as you--

238
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,643
Are you listening to me?

239
002304 53,852 ==> 00730: 54,895
Hello?

240
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,202

241

This is it, right? Last stop?

242
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,982
Last stop?

243

00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,028

Hey, I've been counting, yo.
No more pickups after--

 

 

244
00233:50,820 =-> 00:33:56,409

I'm gonna need to be picked up. Now.

245
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,624
Garcia's on Central. Honk once.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

246
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,798
Cancel that.

248
00234 $21,393 ==" 0073.4: 25,355
This dude was coming right at me
with a shotgun.

249

They blocked the alley and they were
gonna rip us off. I didn't have a choice.

250
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:35,031
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car, and just--

251
00234: 35,991, ==> 00934237, 659
I saw.

252
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,327
You saw.

253
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,830
Jesus.

254
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,873
I just--

255
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,209

256

I'll take a coffee.

262

Didn't know
you started drinking coffee.

263
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:58,323
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces too, all by myself.

264
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,950
Go grab a mug.

265

266
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,254
Just black.

267

Black. I like it.

Yo, what's up?

281

Where were you?

I was out with Mike,
helped him make pickups.

00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,156
-Picking up what?
-Cash. Dead drops.

289
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,035
Mike made the pickups
and I guarded him.

290
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,870
YOUbs «a

291
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,330
..-guarded Mike?

292
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,582
What is this, a joke?

293
00238212,791 --> 00:38:15,877
Hey, know what? Two dudes tried
to rob us and I saved the stash.

294
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:20,423
I took care of business, just like
I'm taking care of business right now.

295
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,594
You wanna stand there dicking around,
or you wanna suit up and get to work?

296
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:29,224
Get in gear, yo, because I'm
meeting up with Mike this afternoon.

297
00238:29,432 => 00:38: 31,26)
What, again? Why?

298
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,437
Guess I have two jobs now.

29.9
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,498
Los Pollos Hermanos,
can I take your order?

300
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,216
Any injuries?

301
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,928
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

302
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,016
It all went like you thought it would,
more or less.

303
00239212,725 --> 00:39:16,729
I will, of course, reimburse you
for the damage to your vehicles.

304
002392 15,315 =“ 00:39: 21,150
Questions?

305
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,028
More than a few, yeah.

306
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,114

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

But I know better than to ask.

307
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,784
Anyway...

308
002397 30,285 ==> 0023.93 32,370
.+-just like you wanted.

309
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,914
The kid's a hero.

310
00:39:52,515 =-> 00:39:55,810
Just the idea of owning a car wash
seems so daunting, but I have to....

311
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:59,439
Who is just the most beautiful little girl
in the world? You.

812
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,275
So coming into a business
that's up and running...

313
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,737
...fully operational,
puts us way ahead of the game.

314
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,448
We're gonna still have some
changeover time.

815
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,116
We'll have to hire some people.

 

316
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,827
But we do have a staff in place,
so, you know...

317
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,164
..we'll be able to hold on
to most of Bogdan's employees.

318

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,751
We might lose a few
to the UltraWash across town, though.

S19)
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,211
They're making a grab, I hear.

320
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,547
-Gonna put the kid to work?
-I've got school.

B22.
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28, 843
Not you. I'm talking about your baby
sister. I wouldn't let you near my car.

322
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,346
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.

323
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,015
You should put Holly on the sign.

324
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,769
-Like a mascot?
-Like the Gerber baby.

325
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,230
I would get my car washed there
if I saw her face out front.

326
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,482
What about me?

327
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46, 486
The goal is to bring customers in,
not scare them away, So....

328
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,492
Walt, there's another bottle
in the kitchen. Just help yourself.

329)
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,202
Good.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
330
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,581
Maybe we could roll Uncle Hank
through the car wash.

33.1
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,084
He could be the first customer.

332
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,587
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

333
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,590
I got your wipe-down right here.

334
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,970
Hank, can we get through one meal
without you grabbing your crotch?

335
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,890

So, what are you gonna do with Holly?
You can't take her to work...

 

 

336
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,978
.-with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

337
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,398
-Marie--
-What? That can't be safe.

338
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,234
Fortunately, five minutes
from the car wash...

339
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,821
...there is the top child-care center
in the city.

340
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,199
The National Child Care Association
gives it high ratings.

341

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:38,037
So that's a huge relief and, you know,
we could walk there if we had to.

342
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:43,459
Sky, I gotta tell you, I'm just--
I'm really, really impressed.

343
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,880
You came together on this.
I'm happy that it's working out for you.

344
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,592
It's been a little scary,
but it needed to be done.

345
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,886
And we get possession of the keys
tomorrow.

346
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,723
Oh, that's awesome.

347
00241: 56,931. <-> 00342200,351
I can't wait to see what kind of car
I'm going to get for my birthday...

348
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,395
.-now with all this money rolling in.

349
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,440
You've been spending too much time
around your Uncle Hank.

350
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,526
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Right, Uncle Hank?

351
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,779
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

352
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15, 867

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Hey, Nick the Greek,
you gonna share that bottle or what?

353
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,368
Yeah. Sorry.

354
00242217,577 ==> 00242: 18,995
Who's Nick the Greek?

355
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,247
He's a famous big-time card player.

356
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,915
Hank, that's not funny.

357
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,585
-What? It's a compliment.
-That's even worse, then.

358
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,087
You're giving
positive reinforcement...

359
00242:28,296 => 00:42: 32,592
...to behavior that Walt
is working very, very hard to change.

360
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,845
-Right, Skyler?
-Yeah.

3161
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,182
I don't see how it's bad.
Dad's raking in the beaucoup bucks.

362
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,977
You know, I just think
maybe we could change the subject?

363
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,982
Yeah. Sure. You know. Absolutely.

364

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,027
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at...

365)
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,821
..with that crazy singing guy?

366
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm off that. I gave my assessment
to A.P.D. I'm done.

367
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,120
The case of the crazy singing guy.

368
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,164
Sounds like
an Encyclopedia Brown story.

369
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,210
Crazy is the wrong word.

370
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,756
This guy, Gale Boetticher,
he was eccentric.

3871
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,636
A real character, you know?
He's dead now.

372
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,431
-Who was he?
-He was a meth cook.

373
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,600
He was a meth chef.

374
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:28,147
I mean, we're talking five stars.
Candles and white tablecloth.

375
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,901
Hey, I can't believe these words
are gonna come out of my mouth...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
376
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,531
...but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

377
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,494
I mean, boy, if he had applied that
big brain of his to something good...

378
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,622
...who knows, he could've helped
humanity or something.

379
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:49,460
I mean, how many actual geniuses
are there in the world, right?

380
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,297
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction, who knows?

381
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,299
Hank...

382
00:43:55,591 --> 00:44:00,972
...not to tell you your business,
but I'm not sure I agree.

383
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,807
-What do you mean?
-Well, I mean...

384
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,769
...you showed me that notebook,
and from what I saw--

385
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,105
And this is just my humble opinion.

386
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,525
From what I saw on those papers....

387

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,194
Genius?

388
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,156
Not so much.

389
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,451
I mean, there was no reasoning,
no deductions in those pages.

390
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,955
So to my eye, all his brilliance...

391
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:31,961
..-looks like nothing more
than just simple rote copying.

392
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,673
Probably of someone else's work.

393
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,803
Believe me, I have been around
enough students to know.

394
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,602
This genius of yours...

395
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,315
.»-maybe he's still out there.

396
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06, 913
-Hank.
-Hey, babe.

397
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:13,294
Tim stopped by. He brought over
some file boxes on that case.

398
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,671
-Thought I'd take another peek.
-That's great.

399

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00245317,632 =-> 00°45:19,217
Sorry about the mess.

400
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,761
No, no, no. Don't be.

401
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,889
You want me to make some coffee?

402
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26, 682
Yeah.

403
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,725
Yeah, that'd be good.

404
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,634
You find something?

405
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:07,682
Oh, just this guy I'm looking at.

406
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,269
You know,

everything he buys and eats...

407
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,898
...is organic, fair trade, vegan.

408
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23, 614
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

Hey.

3
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,559
It's me.

4
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,895
I wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids.

5
002.03: 53,567 =-> 00:03:55,318
I love you.

6
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,824
It's me.
7

00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:06,204
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and--

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,895
-Morning.
-Afternoon.

9
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,440
Oh, really? Jesus.

0
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,568
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

1
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,737
You needed it.

 

2
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,336
Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

13
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,547

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I mean, I might have said
some things that--

14
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,592
Did you know
this Gale Boetticher person?

15
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,223
-Skyler, I can't even focus on--
-Gale Boetticher.

6
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,809
Did you know him?

7
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,311
My God. What--?

8
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,481
What exactly did I say last night?

 

9
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,650
Just enough.

20
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,903
Did you work together?

 

 

21
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,036
Who killed him?

22
00205728,995 ==> 0030.53 31,581
Was it the people you work for?

23
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,751
Definitely not.

24
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,378
Was it somebody who...

25
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:42,843
...at some point,
might wanna do the same to you?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
26
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,225
I seriously doubt it. No.

27
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,730
God.

28
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,027
Oh, God.

29
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,745
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

30
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,791
I know exactly what happened
last night. I drank too much wine.

Sak
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,377
You told Hank...

32
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,132
..-that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

33
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,970
That it might not be this Boetticher
after all.

34
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:32,976
And I was up all night, wondering
why you would say that to him.

35
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,686
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

36
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,065
No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.

37
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,111
Your business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

38
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,406
Look, I don't want to talk
about any of this. Ever.

39.
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,993
The firewall, all right?

40
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,120
Church and state.

41
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,123
That's how we need to approach
this thing.

42
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,671
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day...

43
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,216
.-when you said you loved me.

44
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,222
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you--

45
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,810

I don't know, that you were regretting

what's happened between us.

46
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,312
And I get that.

47
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,106
After last night, I....

 

48
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,530
Walt, I think you're scared.

49
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,409
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

50
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,328
No, Skyler.

51
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,706
-I think last night was a cry for help.
-Oh, Jesus.

52
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,291
A cry for help?

53
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,336
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

54
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,007
That: Ls “jusst.....

55
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:51,304
That is it exactly. Yes.

56
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,640
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

57
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,891
God.

58
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,851
At least this would all be over.

59
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,481
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous
weight just lifted off of me.

60
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,817
Now I understand myself.

61
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05, 610
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08, 488

Walt, I've said it before.

63
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,992
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

64
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,580
-I don't wanna hear about the police.
-I do not say that lightly.

65
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,874
I know what it could do
to this family.

66
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,380
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot--

67
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,549
I don't wanna hear about the police.

68
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,970
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

69
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,431
That's what we tell them, the truth.

70
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,225
-That is not the truth.
-Of course it is.

71
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,729
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money....

72
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,107
-We're done here.
-Roped into working-- Unable to quit.

73
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,401
You told me that yourself, Walt.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

74
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,447
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Walt, please.

75
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,409
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing...

76
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,327
...and admit you're in danger.

77
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,416
Who are you talking to right now?

78
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,337
Who is it you think you see?

719
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,759
Do you know
how much I make a year?

80
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,762
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

81
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,474
You know what would happen
if I decided to stop going in to work?

82
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,978
A business big enough that it could be
listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

83
002:09;322,187 =—> 00:09:25,857
Disappears. It ceases to exist
without me. No.

84
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,111
You clearly don't know who you're
talking to, so let me clue you in.

85
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,282

I am not in danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

86
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,578
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

87
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,831
I am the one who knocks.

88
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,374
Look, I was....

89
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,057
Skyler?
90
00:11:02,537 =-> 00:11:05,999

Here we are. Just like you left it.

91
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,712
And where is your pretty wife?
92
00: 211,379 => 00: 214,424

She has other business to attend to.

93
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:21,181
Well, like I say to her,
place sells as is. Understand?

 

 

 

 

94
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,892
Yes, I understand.

95

Good, good.

96

I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

97

So here is everything you need.

100
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,410

Being boss is tough.

I know you think I was hard on you,

but you'll learn.

106

Being in charge is not easy.

It takes hard work.

I would be handing these keys to you?

I'm on my way.

You need any help?

 

40
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,918
No.

41
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,940
You want me to call her back?

 

42
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,151
No. No.
43

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,241
What exactly did she say?
I mean, exactly.

144
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,372
Just, you know, she asked if
I was okay and not to worry.

 

 

145
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,249
Like that.

146
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,339
Any rough timetable on this thing,
as to when she's coming home?

147
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,846
It's about the gambling, right?

148
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,434
Well, it's kind of hard to--
149
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,686
Dad, she can't understand.

150
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,482
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

151
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,485
It's not that simple.

152
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:36,907
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

153
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,661
-No, it's not. Not at all.
-Yes, it is. I read online.

154
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,581
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you.

155
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,500
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

156
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,128
Son, these are two
very different things.

157
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,673
Not really.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.

158
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,509
-You can't--
-Listen, what is going on with me...

159
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58, 346
...is not about some disease.
It's about choices.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,097
Choices that I have made.

Choices stand by.
62
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,904
You're not moving back in, are you?
63
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,205
No.
64
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:35,091
Hey, you know what?
School can wait.
65
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,804
Why don't we take a little detour?
66
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,099
What kind of detour?
67
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,976
You'll see.
68
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,567
Charlie, pick up line three.
Line three, Charlie.
69
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,784
I think it's time we got you
your own car. What do you think?
70
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,578
What?
71

00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,042

I think

if you're

 

72

gonna buy me off...

00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,878

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

73
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,134

-Amazing. It's amazing.
-Yeah. It's good-looking.

00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,732
You're actually here? To work?

80
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,861
Yeah, man. Jesus.

81
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20, 488
Jesse.
82

00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,199
Come here.

 

83

00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26, 368

-All right, I need an update.
-Update on what?

 

 

184
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,956
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

185:
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,961

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

186
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,884
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

187
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,969
I said I guarded him.

188
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:48,974
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

189
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,185
And this has to be you?

190
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56, 982
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads...

191

00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:01,195

..that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

 

92

00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,449
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

93
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07, 952
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

 

94
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,496
Your hands registered
as lethal weapons?

195
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,747
Register this.

196
009223 11,956 =—> 00222915,417

do you not even question this?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

anything to these people?

Not trying to insult. Just trying to
make you see things.

199
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,220
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

I see this thing probably started

But you know what?

202
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,940
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

203
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,944
So maybe I'm not such a loser
after all.

204
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,741
I mean, what if it--? Oh, God.

205
00222:56,458 ==> 00922259, 879
-All right. What if it's all just a setup?
-What?

206
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,300
What if this robbery that you stopped
wasn't even real?

207
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,720
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

He steps out for one second
and what happens?

209
00223: 10,514 ==> 00:23:13,559
-You immediately get robbed.
-You are such an asshole.

210
00223213, 767 --> 00°:23% 17,229
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer. Like you said...

211.
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,066
...Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

212
O0e23321,.275 => 00223923,.277
He hates the fact that he needs me.

213
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,156
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

214
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,034
If you'd been there,
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

215
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,746
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

216
00223:33,954 --> 00:23:37,833
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

217
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:43,589

No, no, this whole thing, all of this...

218
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,551

What's the deal?

246
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:00,632
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

247
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,885
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

248
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,929
Yeah? What for?

249
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,515
A little birdie told me
there's some guys...

250
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,935
...that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

251
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,439
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

252
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,484
So, what's the plan?

253
00:30:20,527 =-> 00:30:22,070
I just told you.

254
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,990
We sit here and watch that house...

255
002307325, 198 => 002307227, 993
.-until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

256
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,913
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

Why don't you just go
break the door down...

...-pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

259
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:43,800
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

260
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,094
...and most likely armed.

261
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49, 848
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads--

Or maybe you do.

263
002302 52,392 => 00330254, 770
They're kind of unpredictable.

264
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:59,024
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

265
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,905
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

266
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,077
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

364
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01, 644
Hey.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

365
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,857
So that's yours, huh?

366
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,484
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

367
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,029
Well, that was very nice of him.

368
00242:11,738 => 003422 13,281
Yeah.

369
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,659
I know it looks like...

370
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,580
..well, awesome, but it's super safe.

371
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,206
Dad made sure.

372
0042222, 415 => 00%428 25, 710
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

373
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,045
Way below.

374
00242 427,253 ==> 00242: 31,841
And it gets great gas mileage.

375
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,972
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

376
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,558
Just around the block.

377
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,811
Yeah. Just around the block.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
378
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,857
-And be careful, okay?
-I will.

379
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,151
Bye.

380
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,574
It's really-- It's really great
to have you home, Mom.

381
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,542
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

382
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08, 669
-I will.
-Okay.

383
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,773
I guess we should talk.

384
00243:29,357 <-> 00:43:32,068
Well, I think you said plenty
the other day.

385
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,155
Look, about that, it just....

386
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,408
Did you get the car wash keys?

387
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:44,205
Yes. Yes. Here.

388
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:56, 884
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier...

389
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:01,264
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
390
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,726
But I just--
I want you to know something.

39.1,
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,562
I want you to--

392
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,481
I need you to understand...

393:
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,817
...that you are safe.

394
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:18,406
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

395
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,411
Everything that I do, everything...

396
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,873
..-I do it to protect this family.

397
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,712
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

398
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,050
Okay Ds wins

399
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,972
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car...

400
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:48,269
-and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

401
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,566
It goes back.

402

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,318
Tomorrow.

403
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,988
Skyler, it will crush him.

404
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,076
That car directly contradicts
our story.

405
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,747
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family...

406
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,791
...it means protecting the story.

407
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,878
What do you think the neighbors

are gonna say, Walt?

408
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,630
What about Hank and Marie?

409
00245216,130 =-> 00:45:19,675
How about the IRS?

What were you thinking, Walt?

 

410
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:24,680
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

 

411
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,066
Look.

412
00245:37,193 =-> 00:45:40,571
I just worry that he'll blame you
for this.

413
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,077
Oh, he will.

414

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,080
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother...

415
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,251
...for taking away
what his loving father has given him...

416
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,920
...SO thanks for that.

417
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,591
But you know what, Walt?

418
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,302
Someone has to protect this family...

 

419
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,806
...from the man
who protects this family.

1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,691
It came out of nowhere.

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27, 361
You gotta help us.

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,533
-Look at all this damn water.
-Don't drink that.

4
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,994
Ain't no telling
if it's gonna be poison.

5
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,728
Nothing new over here.

6
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,422
How's Junior?

7
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12, 466
Exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15, 886
He hasn't said a word
since we told him it was going back.

9
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19, 640
I spoke to the dealership,
they didn't wanna take it.

 

 

10
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,391
What?

1
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,727
It's in perfect condition.

12
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,855
-It's got 17 miles on the odometer.
-I know.

00202427,022 =-> 00202: 31,193
I spent an hour sweet-talking
the manager down to a restocking fee.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,403
Eight hundred dollars.

15
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,073
Eight hundred dollars?
For two days?

16
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,660
Well, the law says they don't have
to take it back at all.

17
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,039
All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

18
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,583
Make sure you talk
to the general manager.

19
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,502
His name is Glenn.

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,087
Glenn.

21
00802: 50,253 => 00022 53,965
Call me if there's a problem.
And please just don't--

22
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,134
Don't tangle with anyone.

23
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,266
Fine.

24
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,438
Walt.

25
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,388
Shit.

26
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,465
Yes, hello.

27
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,467
I need a cab.

28
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,430
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

29
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,354
I'm at the Pavilion parking lot
on University.

30
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,983
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

31
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,278
Oh, that would be great, thank you.

32
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,072
How long do you think
that would take?

33
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,495
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

34
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,164
Thank you.

35
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,461
Contrition?

36
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,922
Hey, there is total contrition here.

37
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,925
There's mountains of contrition.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
38
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,470
"Fan-tan-tastic."
I will messenger them over right away.

39
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,600
Oh, and about that other thing
unrelated, yes, I can get you in...

40
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,062
...-but I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

41
00207217,520 =-> 00:07:20,106
Oh, yeah.

You wanna make it interesting?

42
O0207120,273 =-> 00707222, 150
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.

43
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24, 402
Prepare to have your ass handed
to you.

44
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,821
Okay. Bye.

45
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,451
He was headed for destruction
of property. Since it's your property...

46
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,747
...I sweated him down
to misdemeanor trash burning.

47
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,250
Now, the only thing is,
it's not gonna be free.

48
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,837
There's a 5 grand fine,
600 for towing and disposal...

49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,131
...3 grand to steam-clean
the blacktop.

50
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,551
So bottom line, your little joyride is
gonna set you back...

51
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,512
..-about 52,000 bucks.

52
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,056
So was it worth it?

58
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,227
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow.
Just tell me it's done.

54
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

55
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,399
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

56
00208302,565 ==> 00:08: 05,276
Your record stays clean,
the wife never finds out.

57
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,489
I've been working magic here.
I could at least get an "attaboy."

58
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,244
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

59
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,176
What is it? Fring?

60
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,263
He will see me dead.

Let's ditch the thesaurus,

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,849
And there's nothing I can do
about it.

62
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,437
All that's left is to wait.

63
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,482
And we're sure about this.

64
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,652
Because Pinkman says
he needs you too much.

65
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,113
"Pinkman says."

66
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,495
"Pinkman says."

67
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,127
Unless...

68
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
-.-you could help me find
a third party.

69
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,592
What third party?

70
002093 11,051, ==> 002093 14,387
Someone who can ameliorate
the situation.

71
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,599

72
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,851
You talking about a hit man?

73
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,771
Assuming that's still

all right?
what they're called.

74
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,522
Wrong answer.

715
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,692
That's what the kids call "epic fail."

76
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,237
All I would need is a phone number.
I'd do the rest.

77
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,074
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

78
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,492
A big one.

79
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,245
If you held my feet to the fire,
I could come up with names.

80
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,332
One or two guys west of the Rockies
who do this work.

81
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,417
But guess what. These guys...

82
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,295
...they know Mike
and Mike knows them.

83
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,964
Mike knows everyone who does this?

84
002093 50,131, == 008095 52,133
Who do you think gave me
their names?

85
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,054
All right. Okay, plan B.

Look, we go outside my network.

86
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,723
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.

87
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,976
Let's say we get lucky.
I mean, incredibly lucky...

88
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,145
...and find a guy who's not a cop...

89
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,398
...0Or some kind
of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

 

90
00:10:07,565 =-> 00:10:10,819
You gotta ask yourself:
How good is good enough?

91
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,948
Whatever goombah we buy
is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.

92
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,491
And Gus Fring?

93
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:21,079
Hey, just winging that guy is
not gonna "ameliorate" your situation.

94
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,039
Not by a damn sight.

95
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,543
I've tried to solve this,
but I can't get anywhere near him.

96
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,961
You can't get near him?

Why don't you ask your partner?

98
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,011
Yeah, I saw him.

99
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,598
And you tell Saul before you tell me?
100
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,434
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

101
-->

00:10:43, 601
Every time I go
Saul hassles me

102
00:10:46,813 -->
He's still

00:10:46,646
over there,
about Mike.

00:10:49,816
scared

the dude's gonna come break his legs.
103
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,694
So I give him the latest.

What happened exactly?

105
00:10:55,321 --> 00:11:01,995
I was at a diner with Mike

and he just shows up.

106
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,664
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

 

 

107
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,416
That's. it.

108
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,712
So this is, like, a regular thing?

109
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,549
How close were you to him?
110
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,925
Close.

dL,
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,429

I mean, closer than you and me
right now.
2.
00: 221,890 --> 00:11:23,308
Did he speak to you?
3
00: 228,521 --> 00:11:30,315
It was over in 10 seconds.
4
00: 230,481 --> 00:11:32,400
Would you just answer?
5
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
He said, he sees things in people.
6
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,365
What things?
7
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,950
What people?
8
00: 241,117 --> 00: 242,202
Me.
9
00% 242,368 --> 00: 245,747
He said he sees something in me.
20
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,131

 

 

A month ago,

 

 

 

 

Gus was trying to kill both of us.

121

00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:00,595
And now he pulls you out of the lab
and employs you as what?

122
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,472

An assistant gunman?

A tough guy?

24
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,602
Does that make any sense to you?

25
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,398
He says he sees something in you.

26
00%12113,942 s=> 00:12:16,361
What kind of game is he playing?

27
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,113
Does he think you're that naive?

28
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,619
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

 

 

 

29
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,832
Well, let alone Gale,
let alone Victor...

130
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,169
...and all the horror
that goes along with all of that.

33
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,427
I mean, the man looked you straight
in the eye...

 

34
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:47,725
...and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy...

...he just--

He winds up....

137
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,900
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

138
00212:58,111 ==> 00:13:00,280
-Okay.
-All I'm just saying is that...

39
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,993

...is it possible that he would think

that you're that weak-willed?

40

Drop the sales pitch.

I'll kill him.

First chance I get.

Pifia colada?

More like stale bubblegum.

 

 

146
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:47,201

Does anyone want their car to smell

I know. But you know what they say.
"The customer's always right."

149

Speaking of customer, it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

-Yeah. He--

 

 

 

56
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:23,738
Lately, his mood's improved
and he's like a maniac with his PT.

157

She just talked me into something
called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

Oh, yeah, it's very important
to maintain your clear coat.

No, that's not the point.

-Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

I was under the impression
that you had this under control.

A DEA hero should never have to pay
for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

No kidding?
Well, I'll take you up on that, for sure.

271
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,551
And how are your mother
and father?

272
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,136
They're good.

-The chicken is great.
-Thank you.

...perhaps something after school,
my door is open.

Can I get you anything else?

279

-A refill, perhaps?
-No, thank you. I'm good.

-Of course.

So where are we going?

282
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,076
Oh, big doings today.

283

The order of the day is eyes open,
mouth shut.

What's up?

285

288

Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

29.1,
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,288
You know how to make coffee?

292
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,789
Sure.

293
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,791
There you go.

294
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,504
-You want a rundown?
-Please.

295
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,341
Three guys up at the gate,
two visible, one in the blind.

296
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,429
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

297
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,891
I got Tyrus down in the tree line
with a Barrett .50.

Planted him there last night,
in case we had any early arrivals.

299

I don't have an extra holster.

300
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,841
Stick this in your pocket.
Keep it out of sight.

301

you're gonna have a gun.

302
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,268
It's loaded?

303
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:50,192
I don't wanna see that in your hand
unless you see me with mine.

304
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,736
Emergency only.

305

Eyes open, mouth shut.

308
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,023
A lot of guns.

309
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,151
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

310
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,490
You wanna sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

311
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,118
I am the guy.

312
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,498
All right, then.

I am the only one coming.

316
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,763
And why is that?

 

317
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,851
My employers feel I can adequately
represent their interests.

318

Please, sit.

3.19.
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,040
This is my offer.

No further payments.
No further contact.

Yes or no?

329
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,094
You know what the Cartel wants.

330
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,140
Anything else would be a waste of time.

331
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,645
Is it to be yes...or no?

332
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,400
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

333
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,322
This is not a negotiation.

334
00831:22,547 => 003312 24,091
You got something of mine?

335
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,725
Glove box.

336
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,148
Figure I better teach you
how to shoot.

337
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,359
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

338
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,239
What is this?

339
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,951

Like what?

343
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,386
If I had to put it in a word...

344

-I'd guess loyalty.

345
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,059
Loyalty.

346
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,400

for the wrong guy.

Okay, we're gonna get started.
You coming in?

355
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,780
So the truth is, we can't change
the past, what's done is done.

356
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,409
We've gotta own our actions,
but putting ourselves on trial...

357
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,538
...acting as our own judge, jury
and executioner, it's not the answer.

358
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,041
A lot of the time,
all that judging does...

359
00233521,208 ==> 002395 25, 629
...is just ensure
that we're gonna repeat the cycle.

360
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,589
Right?

361
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,966
"I'm such an asshole.

No.

I put him down.

383
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,376
I watched him go.

384
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,754
I was looking him straight in the eye.

385
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,635
He didn't know what was happening.
He didn't know why. He--

386
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,015
He was just scared.

387
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,060
And then he was gone.

388
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,771
He was suffering.

389
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,690
It was a kindness.

Never bit anybody.

00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,763
You pick up the rock,

you go right to the dark side.

Anything can happen.

400
002354 41,222 ==> 00:35: 43,558
It ain't no rock that made me do

401
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,186
What was the problem?
Why did you kill him?

Colleen.

409
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,213
Put an ad in the paper,
drop him off at a shelter.

410
00#36:13,380 => 00:36:17,550
You don't just sit there and talk about
killing a helpless, innocent animal.

 

411
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20, 637
We're not here to sit in judgment.

412
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,306
Why not?

413
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,227
Why not? Maybe she's right.

 

414
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,940
Maybe I should have put it in the paper.
I should've done something different.

415
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:39,406
The thing is, if you just do stuff

and nothing happens...

416
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,159
..what's it all mean?

417
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,036
What's the point?

418
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,376
Oh, right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

419
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54, 838
Kicking yourself
doesn't give meaning to anything.

420
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:59,175
So I should stop judging...

421
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,262
-...and accept?
=Tt's a. start.

422
00237:02,429 ==> 00:37:05,098

00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07, 642
...-hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

424
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,894
It's all good?

425
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:16,651
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just,
what, do an inventory and accept?

426
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:24,492
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

438
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,531
Jesse.

439
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,074
Jesse.

440
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,785
Bring a light over here, will you?

441
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,466
Do you see any residue there?

442
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:09,472
-Where?
-Here. On the bottom, right there.

443
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,811
It's been a week. What's going on?

444
00239715,520 ==> 00:39:17,730
I haven't seen him.

445
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,361
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

446
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,470
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy. Look at that.

447
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,266
Graduated to doorman.
Finally found your calling.

448
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,351
Oh, little whiskers, Marie.

449
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,561
What did you do?

450
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,982
Show your barber a picture
of a dog's ass and said, "I'll take that"?

451
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,400
Charming as usual.

452
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,776
Welcome back.

453
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,195
-Looking good, Marie.
-Thanks, Steve.

454
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,533
-Good to see you. How you doing?
-He's fine. We can take it from here.

455
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,702
-Yeah.
-If you wanna hold his elbow.

456
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,956
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

457
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,252
Hey.

458
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,255
Good luck.

459
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,679
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

460
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:41,147
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't
tell you what that means to all of us.

461
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,484
Your progress, it's incredible.

462
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,987
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

463
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,783
-Steve tell you his news?
-What?

Finally got your period?

465
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,079
I made GS-14.

466
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,956
Wow, that's all right, man.

467
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,000
Next stop: Washington, D.C.
Sitting behind a desk...

468
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,628
...papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

469
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,630
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

470
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,840
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

471
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,425
Thanks.

472
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,928
Steve said you might have something

for us.

 

 

473
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,098
Yeah, maybe.
You guys are gonna have to tell me.

474
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,309
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

475
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,769
APD detective?

476
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,188
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.
4717
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,816
The victim's a 34-year-old
male Caucasian...

478
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,110
...-by the name of Gale Boetticher.

479
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,571
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door...

480
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:35,201
...takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

481
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:39,288
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

482
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,500
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

483
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,963
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

484
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,008
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

485
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:55,430
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

486
00:41:55,596 --> 00:42:00,727
And what caught my eye
is his specialty product is blue.

487
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,979
So, what are you thinking?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
488
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,522
This is your Heisenberg?

489
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,445
No. What I think we got here
is Heisenberg's former cook...

490
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,198
...and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

491
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,913
Anyway, lo and behold,
amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense...

492
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,957
«sok Bind this.

493
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,170
Now, this here,
I do a little Google-fu...

494
00242:27,336 <-> 00:42: 31,966
...and I realize it's a parts number
specifically for this baby.

495
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:39,515
That there is a high-volume
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

496
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,559
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

497
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:46,022
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant
or microchip factory...

498
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:51,277
...0r maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

499
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,864

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Okay.

500
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,533
So this little dingus here
is manufactured...

501
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,830
...by a big international concern:
Madrigal Electromotive.

502
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:07,627
I call their Houston office, I get through
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

503
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:11,881
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it, she's pulling files.

504
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:17,470
Six months ago, one of these systems
was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.

505
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,680
Who signed for it?

506
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,224
Gale Boetticher.

507
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:27,313
So I asked my new girlfriend, "Who
paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."

508
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,443
They have no record that anybody
actually paid for this thing.

509
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,072
So I go back and push more
and before you know it...

510
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,324
...the temp's gone,
there's no address.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

511
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:42,495
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer
who's asking me for my badge number.

5.12
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,539
Brick wall.

513
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:49,502
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

514
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,255
Now, Madrigal
is based in Hanover, Germany...

515
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,174
...but they're
what they call "highly diversified."

516
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,137
Industrial equipment, global shipping,
major construction...

517
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,599
...and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food...

518
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,185
...specifically a local chain.

519
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,396
Pollos Hermanos.

520
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,068
Okay. So what, right?
Boetticher's dead.

 

521
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,238
I got no line
on who's been bankrolling him...

522

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,323
...or where his lab was.

523
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,784
The whole thing's a snipe hunt,
right?

524
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:26,038
But now I get this crazy idea...

525
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,541
...and I can't shake it.

526
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,003
I mean, I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling...

527
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,505
...trying to make sense of it.
That napkin.

528
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,340
I told you Boetticher's vegan.

529
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39, 886
We're talking this guy
makes his own fermented lentil bread...

530
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,263
..or whatever the hell that is.

 

531
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:47,894
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

532
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,107
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

533
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,026
Like who?

534
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57, 694

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Well, like, maybe...

535
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,365
...this guy.

536
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,748
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring, huh?

537
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,292
This whole
friend-of-law-enforcement thing?

538
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,629
Could be a case of, "keep your
friends close but your enemies closer."

53.9
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16, 881
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

540
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,801
Maybe he's got the connections too.
Maybe, just maybe...

541
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22, 637
..-he's our guy.

542
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,603
Hank, no offense,
but I think you're really reaching.

543
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,065
If your guy had his meeting at KFC...

544
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:38,277
...you wouldn't immediately assume
he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

545
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,154
You know, I--

546

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,949
I couldn't agree more, guys.

547
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,912
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.

548
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:52,959
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

549
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,379
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat,
you know?

550
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,674
Except...

551
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,720
..-I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing...

552
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,850
...and that is,
what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints...

553
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,479
..-doing
in Gale Boetticher's apartment?

1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,130
-Are we done?
-Listen, I--

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:09, 426
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11, 386
Please.
4

00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,806
I fear for my family.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,518
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
002002 17,976 ==> 00700521,.522
I'm told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,732
It's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,611
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:34,117
-Thank you. Thank you again.
-You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,162
Guys, guys, hurry up.

1
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,332
-Can we go now?
-Upstairs, come on.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,042
What's happening?

13

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,044
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,423
Time of death, 20:43.

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,760
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,561
One of the gunmen died
at the scene.

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,981
The second succumbed to his wounds
earlier this evening.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,816
Agents with the DEA and FBI...

19
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,945
..in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement...

20
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:14,032
...-in an attempt to identify
the deceased suspects. Both--

21
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,093
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,972
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,767
They continued to press me
for my permission to kill Walter White.

 

 

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,606
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,692
But a phone call was placed...

26
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,570
...to Agent Schrader
moments before the attack.

27
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54, 323
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,492
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

29
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,746
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,791

The warning call to the DEA agent...

31
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,670
...Juan Bolsa
may have some insight...

32
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,964
..into who placed it.

33
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,383
Yesterday,
federales raided his hacienda.

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16, 637
And in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

35
008022 Ldyl3dt =<“ 00202219,473
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,226
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25, 896

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,775
At any rate,
I thought you should hear it from me.

39
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,622
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,760
So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,431
What?

42
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,725
I can never remember.

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,729
Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

44
00:03:48,895 =-> 00:03:51,565
No. This is the PET/CT scan.

45
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,110
Positron emission tomography.

46
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:03,869
They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.

47
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,206
Quiet. No magnets.

48
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,208
Right, okay.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,668
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,547
I'm still pretty new at this.

51
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,216
One minute,
I'm starting a new business...

52
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,594
..-my wife and I
are thinking about kids.

53
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,388
Walk into a doctor's office
and suddenly....

54
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,892
-I mean, life as I know it--
-Excuse me.

55
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,520
Yes. I'm waiting
to hear a progress report...

56
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,399
...on the thing we discussed,
so call me.

57
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,448
Anyway, so for me,
that's been the biggest wake-up call.

58
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,576
Letting go, giving up control.

59
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,789
You know, it's like they say,
"Man plans and God laughs."

60
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,752
That is such bullshit.

61
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,504

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Excuse me?

62
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,215
Never give up control.

63
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,177
Live life on your own terms.

64
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,430
Yeah, no,
I get what you're saying...

65
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,766
...-but cancer is cancer, so....

66
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,976
To hell with your cancer.

67
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,230
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

68
00#05213,396 ——> 00:05:17,314
From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

69
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,194
Well, guess what?

70
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,697
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

71
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,244
So every few months,
I come in here for my regular scan...

72
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,289
...-knowing full well
that one of these times--

73
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,875

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Hell, maybe even today.

74
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,754
--I'm gonna hear some bad news.

75
00%05737,963 ==> 0030.53 39,923
But until then...

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,217
..who's in charge?

77
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,094
Me.

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,224
That's how I live my life.

2.
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,828
This residue here is why we descale
with cool water...

80
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,539
...from the walk-in
and not water from the tap.

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,583
Do it again, please.

82
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,839
Pollos Hermanos, where something
delicious is always cooking.

83
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,217
Yes, detective.

84
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,868
Yeah.

85
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,747
-Gustavo, thanks for coming.
-Pleasure.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

86
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,458
-How's Kathi?
-Much better, thank you.

87
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,336
-And you know Hank Schrader?
-Yes, indeed.

88
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01, 963
-And Steve Gomez?
-How was your meal?

89
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,383
Agent Schrader and I had a chance
to catch up at one of my restaurants.

90
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08, 929
I'd eat there every day
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

91
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
-Well, should we get started?
-Yeah.

92
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,227
-I'd like to record this conversation.
-Of course.

93
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:25,779
The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own...

94
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,697
...Sso I've asked them to sit in.

95)
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,534
Gus, we all appreciate your coming
in here to talk to us...

96
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34, 621
..-but you have the right
to have an attorney present.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
97
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,041
Oh, well, I can't see
how that would be necessary.

98
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,251
But then,

I have no idea why I'm here.

99
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,045
So you wish to continue?

100
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46, 967
Please. I'm very anxious
to find out what this is all about.

01
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,804
Sir, your fingerprints were found
at a crime scene.

02
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,265
Really? That's surprising.

03
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,102
A drug-related homicide.

04
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,443
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

05
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,282
So you knew the victim?

 

06

00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,625
Fifteen years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

107
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,503
I named it
after Maximino Arciniega...

108
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,839
...a dear friend of mine
who died young.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
109
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,591
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

0
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,929
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

1
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,848
I see.
2.

00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,561
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in....

 

 

3
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,564
=1,999),
-That sounds right.

114
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,692
And you kept in contact with him
over all this time?

115
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,447
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

116
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,658
-Ran into him where?
-At the restaurant.

117
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57, 620
Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate,
as I assumed...

118
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,791
...he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

119
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,712
He invited me to dinner
the following night and I accepted.

120

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
002093 OF7,1 72 == 008095 11,259
It was perhaps a week later
when I read about him in the paper.

121
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,262
-Drug related, you said?
-It's a good possibility.

122
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,723
The paper made no mention of that.

12:3:
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,601
I assumed
that it was a random crime.

124
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,980
So after years with no contact,
he shows up in your restaurant...

125)
00209%24,147 ==> 007093 27,525
-...and invites you to dinner?
-He wanted money.

126
00209227692 => 00:09: 30, 653
-Gale Boetticher asked for money?
-He didn't say that.

127
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,784
He spoke in terms
of a vague investment opportunity.

128
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,996
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

129
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:45,502
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood...

130
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,755
...-he was more interested
in taking shortcuts...

131

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

...on the

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,675

...than what would or could have been

a very promising career.

132
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,011
Personal shortcomings
notwithstanding...

133
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,388

-he was a warm, gentle person...

134
00209: 57,555 <-> 00:09:59,974
...and I thought a lot of him.

135
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,147
At any rate,
I declined his business offer...

36
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,692
-and after

what was a very pleasant meal, left.

37
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,070

Can you tell us where you were...

38
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,865

at around 8 p.m.?

 

39
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,745

-Not an accusation, just a question.

-No, I understand. Let's see.

140
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,541
Twenty-third.

141
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,586
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

 

 

142
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,464
I was there from 7 to about 10.

night of Wednesday the 23rd
43
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,762
Anyone else?

44
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,560
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

45
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,646
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?

46
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,650
Is it my real name?

47
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,529
I know you're a Chilean national...

 

48
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,907
...but there are no records of you
ever living there.

 

 

149
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,118
Really?

150
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,123
I mean, records show that you
immigrated to Mexico in 1986...

151
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,711
...and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

152
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:15,967
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring
ever having existed in Chile...

153:
OO#1L: 16,134 <> O0s1.12 19,179
..which I find, I don't know, strange.

154
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,764
Well, no, really, it isn't.

155)
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,018

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Pinochet's government
was guilty of many sins.

156
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,562
First and foremost
were human rights abuses.

157
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,649
But it was also notoriously unreliable
at keeping records.

158
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,862
I'm sure if you keep digging,
you'll find me.

 

 

 

 

 

159
00: 238,740 --> 00: 741,326
Okay, I think that's it, Gus.
Thank you.
60
00% 241,492 --> 00: 244,078
I hope that I was of some small help.
61
00: 244,245 --> 00: 247,832
-You were, absolutely. Thank you.
-You're very welcome.
62
00: 347,999 --> 00: 249,667
Good to see you again. Oh, no.
63
OO#11: 49,834 <> 00s.11252,.337
-No, please, please. Don't get up.
-Thanks.
164
00: 257,592 --> 00: 759,219
Gentlemen.
165
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,076
So are we buying?

166
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,578
This thing with his name?
What are you thinking?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
167
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,873
Sure, the record-keeping
in South America's hit or miss.

168
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,542
I mean, we run into that all the time,
right?

169
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,463
But we usually find something.
Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

170
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,676
If State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalized him.

171
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,346
Well, maybe,
but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

172
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,849
State just wasn't as tough
on background checks pre-9/11.

1713
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,270
I don't know what this has to do
with the case at hand.

174
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,232
I was curious when his print showed up
at Boetticher's apartment.

175
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,484
For me, the scholarship explains it.

176
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,945
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

177
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,073
This man has been a longtime friend
of DEA.

178

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,203
But that being said,
I thought his story was credible.

179
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,164
Well, I agree.
I think it was a good story.

180
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,542
Still, why are we hearing it now?

181
00#13212,709 => 00s.139213, 751
What do you mean?

182
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,589
Well, like you said, he's a-- This man
is a big law enforcement booster.

183
00313:18,756 =-> 00:13:22,593
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with...

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,388
...someone he thought a lot of
was murdered.

185
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,391
He reads this
and he doesn't make a phone call?

186
00213428,807 s-> 00213782, 979
Didn't call you
or one of his other cop friends...

187
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,108
...to share his connection with the case
or ask about the investigation?

188
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,403
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation...

189
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,739

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-..On a person
not making phone calls.

190
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,200
What do you think, Tim?

191
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,246
Well, I wanna follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi...

92
00%13:50,413 ==> 00:13:52,415
-but my overall impression?

93
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,791
I believed him.

94
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,555
Nice touch. Birdbath.

 

95
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,517
-Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
-Good.

96
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,522
Yeah, so very nice.

97
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,857
What's the damage?

 

98
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,070
Twelve hundred a month.

I did a lot of research.

 

 

 

99
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,907
-That's a pretty good deal.

-You kidding me? That's a great deal.

200
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,992
Speaking of which...

-Good.

I loved school when I was your age.

-Okay.

The other day, he had a big powwow

What was that about?

246

Nothing. Just a dead-end.

247

He won't tell me, either.

248

Yeah. Sure.

253
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,905
I had a collection of my own

in high schoo

254
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,701
I mean, nothing fancy.
Just entry-level beryls and garnets...

that was very special.

It'd been heat-treated,

He came to the hospital
after the shooting. Put up the reward?

He sponsors the DEA Fun Run

And you said that he didn't strike you
as being the boss-man type?

282
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27, 643
That there was a bigger guy
out there.

283
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,314
-Hank, that was just speculation.
-Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

284

-You think that Gustavo Fring...

...killed Gale Boetticher?

288
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,412
Probably not.

289
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,749
These guys usually get a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So I--

00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,045
So you brought him in to the police?

292
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,008
Right. He sits down to talk with us,
the problem is that--

293
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,218
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

will you let me finish my story here?

interested, you know?

Yeah. As far as DEA
and APD are concerned, he's not.

363
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:48,941
We have a mutual interest
in resolving this without violence.

364
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:54,863
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

365
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,499
Jesse!

366
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,253
What? Oh, hey.
Don't wait to be, like, invited.

367
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,257
Are we alone?

368
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,012
-So where do we stand?
-Where do we stand on what?

369
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,142
Where do we stand with the thing
that you were supposed to do?

370
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,893
I assume you haven't done it.

371
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,773
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

372
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,608
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,946
Asshole. You're creaming
to get it done, go do it yourself.

374
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,449
If he didn't see me coming
like he's some kind of....

375
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,120
All right, look.
Our timetable has advanced.

376
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,040
You have got to make this meeting
happen this week.

377
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,168
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

378
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,297
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

379
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:58,468
My brother-in-law,
my DEA agent brother-in-law?

380
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,013

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

He's onto Gus.

381
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:10,272
Did you hear what I just said?
My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

382
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,651
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

383
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:24, 328
Look. So, what if this is
like math or algebra?

384
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28, 832
We add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag...

385
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,543
...and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

386
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34, 922
I've got some math for you.

387
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,717
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

388
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,431
Hank, he's relentless, all right?
He won't quit.

389
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47, 684
Yeah, well, he's got nothing,
is all I can say.

390
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,063
-How would you know that?
-Because he's still above ground.

391.
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,026
Think a dude like Gus would let

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

your boy anywhere near him?

392
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,196
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

393
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:05,118
So you haven't even seen him
since that time at the diner?

394
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,333
Okay.

395)
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,964
Think. All right.

396
00:29:21,551 =-> 00:29:24,012
They've got to be figuring
that we've talked.

397
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,268
So you need to tell Mike that you
are worried about Hank's investigation.

398
00229329,434 ==> 00929232,813
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

399
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,901
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,
so there's that.

400
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:42,114
This is all good fodder for you
to request a sit-down with Gus...

401
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,742
...SO you can discuss
what you would say for questioning.

402
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,037
Okay? Now, you just say
that you want to be--

No, that you need to be able
to be properly coached.

404
00229753,3875 ==> 003293 55,502
Then, when you're near him...

405
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,212
-you put this to use.

406
00229758,213 s=> 002303 01,633
Mike's just gonna tell me
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

407
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,595
-He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
-Well, then insist on it, damn it!

408
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,556
Act panicked.

409
00230:07,723 --> 00:30:09,725
Gus' ass is on the line.

410
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,728
He'll meet with you
if he thinks you're a liability.

I'm gonna take a piss.
415
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:14,206
I think you got a phone call.

416
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,964
Anything important?

417

00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,538
“Yes?

-I did some digging around.

418
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,290
-And?
-Neither the DEA...

419
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,544
...nor the APD considers you
a person of interest.

420
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,588
Schrader is looking into you
totally on his lonesome.

421
00232:03,755 <> 00:32: 06,591
-A voice in the wilderness.
-Does he have resources?

422
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,095
Just him, his credit card
and his chauffeur Walter.

423
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,766
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

424
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,478
-No warrant for that tracking device?
-No.

425
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,566
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

We watch our backs,
we don't throw him any bones.

427
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,195
He'll never make a case.

428
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,366
-What about Chile?

-If I can't find any trace before '89...

429
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,952
...I seriously doubt Schrader can.

430
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,080
Seems to me
the bigger problem is the cartel.

431
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:41,084
Now, we can handle them
if that's all we've got on our plate.

432
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:46,131
But dealing with both Schrader
and the Mexicans at the same time?

433
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,594
If he happens to be watching
when they make a move...

434
00:32:50,927 =-> 00:32:53,722
...it could be the perfect storm.

435
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,474
Thank you.

436
00232755,640 ==> 00332: 57,601
I'll be in touch.

437
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,760

and grandpas we got.

Is there a couple of them

Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."

440
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,152
Hello, Hector.

441
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,160
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum.

442
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,496
To which I've said no.

443
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,170
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

444
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,342
He's looking into my past.

445
00234 425,939 ==" 0073.4: 29,109
Is today the day, Hector?

446
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,577
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

447
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,001
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

448
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,003
Everything is going to be okay.

449
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,650
Are you crazy?

00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,824
And you?

453
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,368
They ain't gonna say nothing.

454
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,829
They like what they see.

455
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,722
You're not going to offer
our guests anything?

456
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,308
Who says they're guests?

457
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,270
If the boss wants them to drink...

458
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,898
...-they drink.

459
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,197
So...the Chicken Brothers.

460
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,867
I like your restaurant.

461
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,040
Dark meat and white meat?

462
00236307,415 ==> 0073.6: 09,793
Don't look like no brothers to me.

463
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,506
At last!
464
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,299
The master chefs!

YOU CWO ses

466
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,139
That chicken you cook....

467
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,061
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest
chicken in all of Mexico.

468
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,771
Thank you, Don Eladio.

469
00236:30,271 --> 00:36:31,523
It's a great honor.

470
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,941
Max is the chef.

471
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,818
The compliments are all his.

472
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,528
Gustavo is too modest.

473
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,655
There'd be no restaurant without him.

474
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,117
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

475
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,621
Your chicken, it's so...zesty.

476
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,957
Piquant.

477

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,127
But it does not taste
like a Mexican style.

478
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,421
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

479
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,424
...which I've modified a bit
for the Mexican palate.

480
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:02,345
I bet we like a little more chili
than you Chileans.

481
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:07,350
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

482
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,819
So...if your partner is the chef...

483
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,321
...then who are you?

484
00237 420,905 ==" 00737: 23,867
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

485
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,496
I handle the business operations.

486
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,459
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

487
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,461
Es el businessman.

488
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,296

Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

We have several side dishes.

Rice. Beans.

00237:54,522 =—> 00:37:56,900
Sometimes we prepare
a carnitas entrée...

..if we come across fresh beef
in the market.

497
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,238
Anything else?

498
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,908
Come on, be honest.

499
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,871
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

500
00#38:10,038 => 00.38: 12,832
Something on the side?

501
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,837

to your restaurant...

With all due respect, Don Eladio.

508
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,237
I didn't sell it to them.

509
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,239
I gave them samples.

Samples.

Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

I am a biochemist by training.

524

The methamphetamine we make
is much superior...

...to the so-called biker crank
you know of.

526
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,090
It is crystallized, like glass.

00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,555
...dts very structure, is different.

530
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,682
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

53aL
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,019
This product is the drug of the future.

532
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58, 980
It'll triple your profits.

533
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,274
Perhaps quadruple.

534
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,153
They're not only good cooks...

5.35)
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,322
...they're great at shoveling manure.

536
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,750
Right now, you deal almost exclusively
with cocaine.

537
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,044
But the coca plant can't grow
in Mexico.

538
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,297
You are no more than middlemen...

539)
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,466
...for the Colombians.

540
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,220
They cut you a percentage for
smuggling across the border.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

541
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,352
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

542
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,357
...despite your assumption
of all the risk.

543
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,109

This new crystal methamphetamine....

544
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:50,198
It's stronger,
more addictive than cocaine...

545
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,785
. which means
it will move in higher volume.

546
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,955
But most importantly,
it's completely artificial.

547
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,457
We can show you
how to manufacture it...

548
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,792
...-right here in Mexico.

549
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,212
And you keep all the profits.

550
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,010
My men do like your product.

551
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17, 642
Hector, what is wrong with you?

552
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,270
Why did you not get glasses

for our guests?

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

553
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,357
Go on.

554
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,572
You are quite the talent.

555
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,619
I bet you learned cooking
from your mama. Isn't that true?

556
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:42,625
But...what about the chemistry?

557
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,920
I studied at the University of Santiago.

558
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,339
Gustavo paid for my education.

559
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,590
Oh, really?

560
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:55,471
I have degrees in both biochemistry
and chemical engineering.

561
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,141
With minimal capital investment...

 

562
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,768
+..we can set up
a factory-grade laboratory for you.

 

563
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,188
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

564
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,232
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

565

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,693
Fantastic!

566
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,073
Tell me one thing, though.

567
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,743
If you're the cook....

568
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,078
Why do I need him?

569
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,041
Sefior?

570
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,501
You.

S71
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,253
Businessman.

572
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,341
Why should I negotiate with someone
who doesn't respect me?

513
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,930
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

574
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,976
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

575
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,563
..-in front of my own men?

576
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48, 983
What do I need you for?

577
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,695
Don Eladio. Please.

578

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,530
I didn't sell anything.

579
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,908

I apologize if you are offended...

580
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,286
...by my method
of obtaining this meeting.

581
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,873
I merely took the initiative.

582
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,878
I meant no insult.

583
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,255
Don Eladio,
Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

584
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,132
I know Gustavo like a brother.

585
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,634
He's an honorable man.

586
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,553

The most loyal man I have ever known.

587
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,014
He rescued me
from the Santiago slums.

 

588
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,808
He made me the man I am today!

589
00243422,391, ==> 00243: 24,769
Gustavo is a genius.
He will make you millions!

590
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,481

Just find it in your heart to forgive him

this one small mistake.

591
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,358
Please...

592
00343:32,110 =-> 00:43:33,152
He's my partner.

593
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,114
I need him! I swear to God!

594
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,609
Look at him.

595
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,319
You did this to him.

596
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,365
Now, look at him.

597
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,672
Listen to me.

598
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,969
The only reason you are alive
and he is not...

599
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,473

..is because I know who you are.

600
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,350
But understand....

601
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,020
You are not in Chile anymore.

602
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,617
My advice....

603
00245: 03,993 => 00:45:05, 912
Stick to chicken.
604
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,076
Look at me, Hector.

605
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,878
Look at me.

606
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,944
Maybe next time.

1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,493
I got it, I got it.

2

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,830
You're like a bee at a damn picnic,
Marie.

3

00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,333
-Morning.

-Hey, buddy.

 

4
00%01:23,500 ==> 00:01:26,295
-Ready to get your rocks on?
-See? I knew it.

5
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,173
"Mineral show" is just some sort of
guy code for "strip club."

6
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,759
Yeah. You got your singles?

7
00#01:33,594 => 00:01:35,429
-Got it?

-Yeah.

 

8
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,809
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?

]
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,646
Cram one more giant geode in here,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

10
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,149
-Got. it.. I got ait.
-I'm sorry.

11
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,241
Christ. Longest week ever.

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,037
Here's just hoping
we get something good.

3
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,623
Keep your fingers crossed.

4
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,963

Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.

5
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,966
It's more like Rocky, you know?

6
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,271
Get the bad guy.

7
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,317
Yeah!

8
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,953
-But-- What are you doing, buddy?
-Leaving.

 

9
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,873

You gotta go inside, order something

like last time. Avoid suspicion.

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,418
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

21
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,754
We'll use the drive-through.

22
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,597
All right, baby,
let's see what we got.

23
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,201
What the hell? Look at this.

24
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,749
That's work. That's home.
That's work, that's home.
25
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,168
What, this guy...

26
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,587
..-he goes two places every day,
all week?

27
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,047
It's unbelievable.

28
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,676
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

29
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:26,057
Hank, is it possible that maybe,
just maybe...

30
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,852
..-he's not your guy?

31
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,147
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.

32
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,401
What's the play here, buddy?

33
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,196
How do I get this guy?

34
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,490
Yeah.

35
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,325
How?

36
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,053
Yes, hi.

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,141
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place and I want to report.
38
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,436
...a very suspicious man
lurking in my neighborhood.

39
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,354
He's sitting in a blue sedan...

40
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,860
...and he's been staring at
a particular house for a very long time.

41
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,653
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,781
If you would, I would appreciate it.

43
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,190
All right.

44
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,943
I guess we'd better get started.

45
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,070
I already did.

46
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,908
Yeah?

47
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,456
Hey.

48
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,377
Got one of those for me?

49
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,297
-One of those what?
-Cigarette.

50
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,387
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

51
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,936
Just give me one.

52
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,004
So, what have you been up to?

53
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,798
What?

54
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,053
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?

55
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,641
Go home. Watch TV.

56
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,351
What do you watch?

57
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,061
I don't know, stuff.

58
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,397
Well, like what?

59
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,903
Like Ice Road Truckers.

60
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,489
Ice Road Truckers.

61
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,241
What happens on that one?

62
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,577
Guys drive on ice.

63
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,003
I am gonna do it.

64
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,012
You gotta inhale, by the way.

65
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,518
What the hell, man? Don't you have
enough cancer already? Look.

66
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,271
ZT SUG. sus
67

00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,483
-.--I'd do it. I'll do it.

68
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,528
Yeah, well...

69
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,655
..what does it matter?

70
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,324
We're both dead men anyway.

71

00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,278
-Hi.
-Hi.

72
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,822
Am I catching you at a bad time?

73
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,450
No. I have a few minutes.

74
00:09:35,617 =-> 00:09:37,952
So Mr.

I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone...

75
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,956
...doesn't want a big birthday,

just wants to hang out with friends...
76
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,043
-...which is fine by me. You?
-Fine by me.

77
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,715
Okay. So I figured a low-key family
dinner, no official party...

78
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,884
...and we bite the bullet...

79
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,720
...and buy him a car.

80
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,140
Used, I was thinking, would be best.

81
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:04,437
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.

82
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,982
Do you have any thoughts
on what kind?

83
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,902
Or should I just go ahead and--

84
00210: 11,111 => 00:10: 13,905
Yeah. You just go ahead.

85
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,782
Okay.

86
00810¢17,158 ==> 003103 21,871
Listen, on another subject,
I just wanted to tell you...

 

 

 

87
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,082
...that business is good.

88
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,417
Really good.

89
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,839
So good that I'm thinking, maybe...

90
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,216
..you don't need to even work...

91

-We're coming close.

00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:50,400
Give us another month or two and,
yeah, we'll be there.

94
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,444
All of this to say...

95
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,824
.-maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

96
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,871
I'm working on it.

00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

00211: 50; 752
I'm thinking

103

about Gus Fring.

How he never goes anywhere.

00:11:54,047

105

00%11:56,299 =-> 00:11:58,426

I'm even more convinced it's bullshit...

106

00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,054

...because he owns

13 other restaurants. Right?
107

00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,349

 

 

So I start thinking
about this little empire of his.

00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,705
Ted, this is....

This is the CID.

8:46,500

8:46,667 --> 00:18:51,255

Maybe there's some method or some
accounting trick you could use--
208
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,342
Ted, it doesn't work like that.

209
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,594
[The damage is already--

My signatures...

213

Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.

 

214
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,402
Let me explain
what's going to happen here, okay?

215
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,572
Once the CID
sees this is willful tax fraud...

 

 

 

216
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,950
...they will build the strongest
possible case against you.

217
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,622
Once they start down that path, they
have an 80 percent conviction rate.

218
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,708
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail...

219
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,046
...and tap your phones,
and not just you, Ted...
220
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,466
..-.everyone involved in those books.

221
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,347
I can't have this in my life.

229
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,058
I cannot be audited.

223
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,812
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?

They're after me.

 

 

224
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,315
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

225
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,861

Look, I don't want you
to worry, okay?

228
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:08,290
I'm going to figure out
a way through this, somehow. Okay?

229
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
Here.

230
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,030
So is he gonna kill him?

231
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,619
Is who gonna kill who?

232
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,665
Gus.

233
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,918
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's
brother-in-law?

234
002203 55,880 ==> 00:20: 59,675
I mean, he's the reason
for all of this here, right?

235)
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:06,932
Because it's totally logical for him
to off the dude.

236
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,606
A-hole DEA agent
poking around your junk.

237
00:21:15,316 =-> 00:21:17,777
Who needs that, right?

238
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,824
Makes sense to get rid of him
for good.

239
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,000
But killing a cop...

240
00221:33,167 ==> 00:21:35,085
...I don't know.

241
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,923
It could look suspicious...

242
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,761
..if the dude who's investigating you
suddenly up and dies.

 

 

243
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,019
Then there's-- There's Mr. White...

244
00:21:53,562 =-> 00:22:00,236
...who would be even more apeshit
if he had family getting murdered.

245
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,117
He'd never cook for Gus again.

246
00222:12,665 ==> 00:22:17,294
Guess there's a lot of angles
to consider.

247
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,886
If something were to happen to him,
would you have a problem with that?

248
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,394
Who really cares what I think?

249
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,075
Son. of a bitch.

.the answer is "yes."

255
00225236,085 --> 00725: 38,912
-Should I even ask?
-I wouldn't.

256
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,922
So, what? Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

257
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,634
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.

00225:53,177 --—> 00:25:55,512
Just grab us a spare barrel,
Walter.

259
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,224
What was it this time?

260
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,311
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

261
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,646
Or did Gus need to send
another message?

262
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,106
Shut your mouth.

263
002263 06,732 ==> 00226: 09,151
You shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you.

264
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:13,614
I don't want you talking to me
or Jesse. Just get the barrel.

265
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,576
And if you ever plan on calling
the cops on one of my guys again...

266
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,915
.»..you go ahead and get two barrels.

267
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,704
Like...

268
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,251
-I guess I never thanked you for
what you did.

269
00227:09,294 =-> 00:27:10,379
Thanks.

270
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,136
Next time don't stand there
like an idiot.

271
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,430
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.

272
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,142
But seriously, what--?

273
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,019
-What was the deal with Gus?
-The deal?

274
00227:26,812 => 00:27:30,315
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.

2715
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,568
What the hell was he doing?

276
00227:33,068 => 00:27: 35,237
The cartel needs Gus.

277
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,656
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.

278
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,952
But, what? The rest of us are like
open season?

279
00%27:42,119 ==> 00:27:45,539
Is he doing anything about that,
or do we keep hanging out...
280
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,208
-...for target practice while he--?
-Kid.

281
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:53,463
Enough. You got questions,
ask him yourself.

282
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,351
And here again.

283
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,188
Unreported income.

284
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,774
That's more than a year straight so far.

285
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,655
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

286
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,908
I'd have to...

287
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,913
..-have a look at the copies of
the receipts to refresh my memory.

288
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,000
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.

289
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,758
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

290
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
I got lost. Hey, Ted.

291

00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,389
-Sky.

-This building is so confusing.
292
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,558
There are doors everywhere.

293
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,937
-Hi. You are...?
-Special Agent James Bekaris.

294
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,314
"Special." Skyler White.

295)
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,735
Ms. White,

you are the accountant of record...

296
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,446
...for many of these reports,
is that correct?

297
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,990
-Guilty as charged.
-Can you shed light...

298
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,368
...on this history
of missing revenue?

299
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,912
Missing? No, it's there.

300
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,290
No. Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company...

301
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,585

..but it's not all accounted for

in your reports.

302
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
Let's take a look.

303
00329:321,677 =-> 00:29:23,971
Oh, well, you know...

304
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,432
...this account here,
that is Mr. Keller's account.

305
00229327,683 == 002293 30,269
And Mr. Keller is an old friend
of Ted's dad.

306
00229: 30,519 =-> 00:29:32,813
He always sends
an electronic payment...

307
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,732
..-which I hate,
because I'm a real-paper person.

308
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,610
Mr. Keller is
one of those environmental people.

309
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,988
Since there wasn't
a physical check...

310
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,992
...I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.

chee
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,289
Ms. White, you've read Section 61
of the IRC?

312
00229:50,455 => 00:29:53,417
I did not follow what you just said.

 

313
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:58,422
How gross income for a business is
defined, you're not allowed to do that.

314
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,882
-Well, I think I am.
-No, you're not.

315
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,304
Well, you know what they say about
opinions, right? Everyone's got one.

316
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,181
But seriously, I am.

317
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,019
It doesn't matter if it's an
electronic check or a paper check...

318
00230212,185 --> 00:30:15,355
...income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.

31.9
00230715,522 ==> 00:30:18,358
When I input everything
into the Quicken...

320
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,696
. nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?

321.
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,324
Quicken.

322
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,370
You used Quicken to manage books
for a business this size.

323
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,790
I did. Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.

324
00230733,957 ==> 003303 37,544
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

325
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,630
-Ms. White, how did you get this job?
-Ted hired me.
326
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,091
No, I mean your qualifications.

327
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,720
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?

328
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,931
Well, I haven't had any training,
per se.

32:9)
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,559
I've always been naturally good
with numbers.

330
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,188
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?

331
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,026
Right.

332
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,739
This is all falling into place now.

333
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,080
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...

334
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:17,209
-...anywhere else, are you?

-Right now? No.

 

 

335
00231217,.376 =—> 00:31:19,669
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

336
00231:21,254 --> 00:31:25,050
I'm not really clear about what
happened in there.

337
00331:25,217 =-> 00:31:28,512
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law...

338
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,432
..doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.

339
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,893
Pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties...

340
00231:35,060 --> 00:31:37,729
...and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

341
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,606
Pay with what?

342
00%31<39,773 ==> 003314 42,275
I owe them $617,000. What am I--?

343
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,488
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.

344
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,700
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,
take out a second mortgage--

345
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,203
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

346
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,540
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.

347
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,335
Ted, if you don't pay them,
they will reopen the investigation...

348
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:05,006

...and that little fiction I just spun up
there is gonna completely unravel.

349
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
You have to settle.

350
00%32<11,430 ==> 00:32:13,056
Wish I could.

351
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,479
Come in.

352
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,455
I hope you brought an appetite.

353
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,043
Yeah, I guess.

354
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,424
Mike mentioned you have
some questions.

355
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,429
Yeah.

356
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,309
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.

357
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,442
Right on.

358
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,706
What am I doing here?

359
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,053
I know you have concerns.

360
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,849
What happened yesterday,
to my man at the farm...

361
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,977
..-it was a terrible thing.

362
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,397
The dude getting his head
blown off? Yeah.

363
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,276
I've invited you into my home...

364
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:34,656
...prepared food
so we could sit and talk.

365
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,869
Discuss what's going on in
this business...

366
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,123
...our business, like men.

367
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,127
And I will explain everything
that is happening.

368
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,504
I will answer your questions.

369
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,257
But first. .

370
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,845
.I need you
to answer one question for me.

371
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,558
Can you cook Walter's formula?

372
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,769
What?

313
002352 05,812 => 003.5: 07,\689
Walter's formula.
374
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,193
Can you produce his product
without any help? Alone.

375
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,696
No.

376
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,117
Why?

377
00835¢19,909 s=> 002358 23,,079.
You're asking me if I can cook
Mr. White's crystal?

378
00%35:24,122 ==> 00:35: 25,832
Without him?

379
00235:26,583 --> 00°35: 27,667
Me?

380
00235:28,918 =-> 00235:31,129
The junkie loser
you were about to waste...

381
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,632
...and dump in the desert
a month ago.

382
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,800
This your plan?

383
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,888
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is...

384
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,767
...-be my buddy...

385
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,187
...and make me feel important.
386
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,653
Then get me to keep cooking for you
after you kill Mr. White?

387
002352 56,696 => 00:35:59,324
You wanna--
You wanna talk like men?

388
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:05,372
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

389
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,249
That is not what I asked you.

390
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,838
You are here because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

391
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,466
And I need your help.

392
00#36:18,009 => 00:36:20,512
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

393
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,556
Now, if you would...

394
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,018
...answer the question.

395)
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,457
Hey, you headed out?

396
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,836
Yeah.

397
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:24,177
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta
talk to you. I don't know if you're...
398
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,097
...with your family or whatever,
but this is important...

39.9
00#38:28,264 => 00:38: 31,935
...Sso I'm hoping you could come over.

400
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,070
Thank God. Come on in.

401
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:49,077
-You-- You want a beer or something?
=NOx

402
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,206
-Should I sit down?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

403
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,125
Okay, sSo....

404
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,797
Okay, so word has come down
that they--

405
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,883
They want me to go to Mexico.

406
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,137
There's some--
Some sort of war brewing...

407
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,975
-...between Gus and the cartel.
-"Word has come down"?

408
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,854
The cartel has been-- Has been
messing with Gus' operation.

409
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,731
Like jacking trucks to,
like, send a message.

410
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,901
And yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

411
00239%22,151, == 0073.95 26,656
I mean, they shot him right in
front of me. Just blew his head open.

412
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,451
Some sniper nailed him from
like a mile away.

413
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,914
Anyway, they've been holding
them off.

414
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,542
But between the cartel
taking potshots...

415
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,588
...and your brother-in-law trying
to throw a net over the whole deal...

416
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,592
..it's like what you call
a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.

 

417
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,387
So, Gus is-- Is gonna cave.
418

00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,100
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation...

419
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,854
...and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.

420
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:03,109
Well, I-- I gotta give it to them. I mean,
I'm supposed to go to Mexico...

421

00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,989
...and teach a bunch of cartel chemists

how to cook a batch of blue.

422
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,242
You know,
and Gus doesn't trust you...

423
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,329
sovO L gotta go.

I mean, you're the chemist, man...

424
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,082
...you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to--

425
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,337
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever...

426
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,006
..and they got like actual chemists...

427
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,259
...like cartel chemists asking me
chemistry stuff...

428
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,512
...that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

429
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,017
And what if all the equipment
is in Mexican instead of English?

430
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,480
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.

431
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,107
I mean, if I mess this up...
432
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,946
..I'm dead, you know? All of us.

433
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,619
Mr. White, look, I need--
I need your help.

434
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,915
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could coach me...

435
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:03,920
-..0r something, you know.
Or give me some notes.

436
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,172
Mr. White?

437
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,092
So you saw Gus?

438
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,970
What? No.

439
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,223
-You didn't see Gus.

-No.

 

 

440
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,018
Then who told you all of that?

441
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,355
It was passed down, like I said.

442
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,234
"Passed down." By whom?

 

 

443
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,028
By.... By Mike and them.

444
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:33,574
-I mean, they did. They--
-So "they" doesn't include Gus.

445
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,451
You haven't been with Gus.

446
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,663
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

447
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,166
-Why are you--?
-You weren't at Gus' house last night.

448
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,501
What?

449
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,506
What the hell? Jesus.

450
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,801
Still here.

451

00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,972

-It's still here.
-Jesus.

 

 

452
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,396
You look me in the eye
and you tell me...

453
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,649
..that you weren't at his house
last night.

454
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,693
Diss 3 &

455
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,573
Look, I didn't have a chance,
all right?
456
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,617
Okay? I knew you would react
this way.

457
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,996
I knew you would freak out
and wouldn't believe me.

458
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,623
That's why I didn't say anything.

459
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,210
Look, there was just this one
big pot of stew.

460
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,297
He just made this one big pot
and we both ate from it.

461
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,008
What was I supposed to do,
poison myself?

462
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,429
Two hours, 18 minutes, you couldn't
figure out a way to give it to him?

463
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,557
-He never left the room.
-You lying little shit!

464
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,310
You had one thing to do, one thing.

465
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,064
That is the only thing, I might add,
that would save our lives...

466
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,233
...-and you were right there.
You were in his house...

467
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,236
..-and you didn't have the guts
to do it.

468
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,618
Two hours and 18 minutes?

469
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,996
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

470
00243:02,163 => 00:43: 05,291
How did you know
I was at his house last night?

471
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,126
Were you following me?

472
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,050
This. This is how I knew.

473
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,308
-You bugged my car?
-/e10 to 92.28 pram.

474
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,479
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?

475
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,190
Not the slightest intention.

476
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,276
Everything that I have done for you.

477
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,029
You put a bug on my car?

478
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,824
I'm sorry,
after everything you've done for me?

479
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,034
What you've done for me?

480
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,453
You killed me, is what you've done!

481
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:47,250
You've signed my death warrant! Now
you want advice? I'll give you advice:

482
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,002
Go to Mexico and screw up
like I know you will.

483
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,505
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!

484
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,907
You son of a--

485
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,245
Can you walk?

486
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,249
Yeah.

487
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,086
Then get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,686
You can do this.

2
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,522
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

3
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,026
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

4
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:36,114
Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

5
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,744
I really wanted to do this together,
but I can hear him getting up.

6
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,830
It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.

7
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,876
So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and l....

8
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,754
I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

9
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54, 633
So call me.

10
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,058
-Hey.
-Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

11
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,184
Thanks, Mom.

12
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,938

Of course,
I thought you might sleep through it.

13
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,693
So since it's almost, oh, noon...

14
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,197
...I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

15
00203:18,.365 <-> 00:03:22,119
-Pancakes?
-Pancakes it is.

16
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,829
Oh, could you do me a favor?

17
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,707
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,750
-Sure.
-Thanks.

19
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,516
Surprise.

20
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,187
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

21
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,569
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. It's.... It's great.
22

00203: 55,861 “> 00:03257, 738
I really did a lot of research...

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,116
...and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

24

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,912
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

25
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,916
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

26
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,336
And, of course,
it is safe because I'm still your mother.

27
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,046
And it has a CD player...

28
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,049
.-SO you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

29
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:23,889

So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

 

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,267
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

31
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:33,064
Yeah, okay. Well, let's....
Let's get those pancakes going.

32
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,653
Saul, he's here.

33
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,325
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

34
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,076
Saul?

35
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,955

Send him in.

36

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,629
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

37
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,882
Hey. Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,967
Have a seat, please.

39
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,470
Teawe: «

40
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,722
I don't understand why I'm here.

41
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,392
-Something to do with my creditors?
-Creditors? No.

42
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,481
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

43
0005316,149 =-> 00:05:17,317
Nothing but lately.

44
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,028
Your great-aunt Birgit passed away.

45
00205321,029 ==> 00205: 22,197
I'm sorry, who?

46
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,077
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

47
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,663
And this was-- Wow, eight years ago.

48
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,291
I just assumed you two were close,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
given that....

49
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,670
Well, maybe this is good news.

50
00205:37,420 ==> 00:05: 39, 631
Birgit left behind a sizable estate...

51
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,260
...of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

52
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44, 469
What?

53
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48, 347
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting...

54
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,310
...while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

55
00705:53,979 =-> 00:05:58,191
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

56
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,444
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

57
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,739
Well....

58
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,830
Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

59
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,457
They traced the inheritance
to your father.

60

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,461
But having passed-- My condolences.
--you are the next in line...

61
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:25,468
...to the tune of $621,552.33.

62
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,301
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

63
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,513
Let's see how the cook goes first.

64
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,682
Who's the chemist?

65
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,687
Is this a joke?

66
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,356
He's asking if you're the chemist.

67
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,732
I'm one of them.

68
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,902
Okay, we've all met.

69
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,363
Let's get to work.

70
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,266
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

71
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,353
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

72
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,731
We synthesize it ourselves.

73
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,025

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
All the ingredients are here.

74
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,154
They synthesize their own.

75
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,448
What?

76
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,744
I don't do that.

77
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,579
What's the problem?

78
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,958
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

79
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,295
That's how I know how to do it.

80
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,593
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

81
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,305
..-would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

82
00209:15,930 ==> 00:09:18,725
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

83
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,062
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

84
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,481
-What's he saying?
-We're working it out.

85
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,690

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
This is ridiculous.

86
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm not letting some infant...

87
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,695
...who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid...

88
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,447
...teach me my business.

89
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,659
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product...

90
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,164
...-he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

91
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,796
I speak English.

92
00:09:48,338 =-> 00:09:50,965
So you understand
what "asshole" means.

93
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,970
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

94
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,390
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

95
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,269
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

96
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07, 482
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,431
And my mom...

264
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,893
...she puts me on her lap.

265
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47, 689
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

266
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,069
But really, he just scares me.

267
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,242
And he's looking right at me...

268
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,956
..-but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

And your grandmother is talking...

270
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,759
...trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does...

271
00227416, 760 ==~ 00227: 19,555

I could remember...

272

THIS g35%

274
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,068
This rattling sound.

275
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,864
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

276
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,123
Like there was nothing in him.

277
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,337
Anyway...

278
00:27:55,424 --> 00:28:00,220
...-that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

279
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:08,937
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

280
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:16,445
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

Remembering you that way...

282

283
002287527, 789 ==> 00328: 31,627
The bad way to remember you
would be the way....

284
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,214
The way you've been
this whole last year.

285
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,676
At least last night you were....

286
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,722
You were real, you know?

287

00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,565

-Bye.

Somewhere you should be?

289
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,727
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

290
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,439
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

291
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,901
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

292
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,488
-Hi.
-Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

-Hey.
-Hi.

295
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,997
Nice surprise. What's up?

296
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52, 666
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

297
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,254
Well, things are....
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.

298
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,505
Oh, yeah?

299
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,508
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

300
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,760
Some very good news...

301
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,055
...and I'm getting the business
going again.

302
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,601
I figure we haven't been down long...

303
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,980
»..SO we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

304
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,357
Oh, thank you. That's--

Gosh, that's....

That's wow.

307
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,073
How is that even possible?

308
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,621
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

309
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,624
I guess someone's
looking out for me.

310
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,376
I guess so.

311
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,506
Is that yours, outside?

32
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,009
Yeah, well, you know...

313
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,178
-I can't be driving a piece of crap.

 

314
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,388
You got to present
that successful image.

315
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:53,393
Right. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

316
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,145
Yeah, it's in progress.

317
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,521

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

So you paid them?

318
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,857
Well, not yet, but I will.

3.19
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,901
When?

320
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,904
Well, it's not that simple.

321
0031705, 113 s=> 003318 09,201
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

322
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,577
So I was thinking...

323
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,623
...I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

324
00#31:14,790 => 00:31:17,876
There will never
be a better deal, Ted.

325
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,379
The deal is you pay
your back taxes...

326
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,507
...you pay your penalty,
and you don't go to prison.

327
00%31:23,673 ==> 00:31:26,676
That's a good deal. So....

328
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,595
Let's keep our priorities straight.

329
00#31:29,054 =-> 00:31: 33,683
Well, my priority

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

is getting my business back.

330
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,313
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay their mortgages.

331
00231:38,480 ==—> 00731241,775
Right. But I think
your employees would agree...

332
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:45,112
...that you need to get
your financial situation in control...

333
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,406
.before you can help them.

334
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,991
Boy, the IRS
got you on commission?

335
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,702
'm just saying that,

though I really understand...

 

336
002315525869 === 00931255, 872
...the temptation
to restart the business...

 

B37
00831: 56,039 -—> 0031057, 916
.-maybe the universe is telling you...

338

341
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,390

Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

342
00232:13,557 => 00:32:16,977
A decision you made, by the way.

343
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,439
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

344
00232:21,982 => 00:32:24,317
-Ted, this affects both of us.
-No it doesn't.

345
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,111
I'm telling you to drop this.

346
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,947
You need to use that money
to pay your bill.

347
00932:29,156 --> 00:32:30,574
By the end of this month.

348
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,660
Which you promised
the IRS in writing that you would do.

349
00232:33,827 =—> 00:32: 36,621
It is that simple.

350
002322377789 --> 00732: 39,207
Okay.

351
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,210
Okay, duly noted.

352
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,962
What does that mean?

353.
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:47,674
Does that mean yes? Because

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I really need a yes here, Ted.

354
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:51,011
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. It means...

355
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,014
..in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

356
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56, 683
And I'm inviting you to, you know....

357
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,103
And thank you for your concern,
but I'm done talking about this.

358
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:33,136
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

359
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,849
Great-aunt Birgit?

360
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,852
That was you?

361
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,605
Yeah.

362
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,768
What is this shit?

363
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,687
I don't get a vote?

364
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,314
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

365
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,068

I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

381
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,233
He cooks better meth than you do...

382

.-with all your fancy
college degrees.

383
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,158
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

384
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,501
What's in there?

385
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,420
A gift?

386

It's a token of respect.

Hey!

Hey! Hey! What about him?
4
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,350
What about him?
5
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,161
Hey. Someone.
6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,707

Help. Assistance.

7
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,793
This man needs help.

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,046
This man pays my salary.

9
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,493
Forty-point-two-three pounds.

you understand?

uit.

14
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,941
I just told you, 40.23 pounds.

15
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,073
Forty-point-two-one.

16
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,058
My brother-in-law, he keeps talking
about driving out to the factory farm.

17
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48, 687
And I have-- I have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

18
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,814
It's really at the point now...

19
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,067
...where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

20
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,487
So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

21
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,616
But I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

22
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,374
Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

23
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,515
Anything suspicious?

24
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,728
Still no, Walt.

25
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,401
Well, then should we go?

26

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,615
Got some place to be? Because it's,
like, the third time you asked me that.

27
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,827
No, I'm just curious
what the next move is.

28
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,206
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

29
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,291
This here's the job, buddy.

30
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,587
Ain't all supermodels and speedboats,
you know.

Si.
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,345
Any cartel news these days?

32
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:08,183
Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

33
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,145
Yeah, well,
not a lot happening stateside.

34
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,482
Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

35
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,193
Lots of bodies, apparently.

36
00205218,360 =-> 00:05:21,029
You know, even by cartel standards.

37
002:053.21.,863 => 00205: 25,951.
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

38
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,625
So when we gonna talk
about your face?

39
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40, 423
-I don't wanna get into it, okay?
-No, it's not okay.

40
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,635
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho...

41
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,179
...and he thinks
we're not gonna discuss it?

42
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48, 682
If you're in over your head
on something...

43
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51, 893
...don't you think I might be the guy
to come to?

44
0005453, 728 =-> 00205: 58,316
You know, one of my old buddies
from Glynco had a gambling problem...

45
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:04,197
...except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack.

46
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:09,953
Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd
playing scratch-and-wins.

47
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,458
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

48
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:21,339
But I know he got on a ride

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
that was rough to get off of.

49
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm just saying I'm here, you know.

50
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,887
If you want to talk about it.

51
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:35,520
I don't want to talk about it,
to you or to anyone else.

52
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,397
I'm done explaining myself.

53
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,554
Hey, you think he needs more blood?

54
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,723
It's in the refrigerator.

55
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,518
What, you--? You want me to...?

56
00207 £29,032 == 00207: 31,201
A-negative, yes?

57
00207:32,535 <-> 00:07:33,870
Your blood type?

58
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,874
I don't know, maybe.

59
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,087
A-negative, 25 years old...

60
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,924
..seventy kilo, 180 centimeters.

61
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:51,471
You smoke, you drink,

you puff, puff, puff.

62
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,516
But no disease, no condition.

63
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,645
No complication
other than an allergy to....

64
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,105
Oh, wait, don't say.

65
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,691
Erythromycin.

66
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,945
But I have cefazolin here,
so no problem.

67
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,114
How do you know all that?

68
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,997
Jesus.

69
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,499
He thought of everything.

70
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,424
O-negative.

71
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,175
That's what he needs.

72
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,308
It's time to go.

73
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,102
What about Mike?

74
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,441
With this injury? No travel.
At least a week.

75
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,611
I'll send for him.

76
00208257,370 ==> 00208: 59,205
You need protection, Gustavo?

77
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,295
I wouldn't have guessed.

78
00209212,802 ==> 00:09: 15,096
Water and rest.

719
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,296
What happened to the plane?

80
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,884
There are many good ways south.

81
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,096
But, unfortunately, only one way north.

82
00209258,556 ==> 00210: 00,975
Six miles to Texas.

83
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,604
I've got a man there
who'll drive us the rest of the way.

84
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,318
I kind of liked the plane.

85
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,658
So you gonna make it?
Six miles is pretty far.

86
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,701
I'll make it.

87

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,374
You did well down here.

88
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,876
And you also proved a point.

89
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,340
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

90
00210332, 507 ==> 00:10:34,175
Don't you?

91
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,184
Let Mr. White go.

92
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,939
Pay him off or fire him.

93
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,899
Don't kill him.

94
002102 53,153 <> 00s102 56, 781
-You know that won't work.
-Then you got a problem.

 

 

95
00: 215,008 --> 00: 218,011
Hi. We're home.

96
00: 220,471 --> 00: 222,640
Are you doing your homework?

97
00: 222,807 --> 00: 224,517
Yeah.

98
00: 225,476 --> 00: 729,147
Well, dinner is in about 30.

99
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,569
Hey, sorry to call you at home...

 

 

 

 

100

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,864

...but I think maybe

you're not getting my messages.

101

00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,451

That or you just

don't feel like talking to me.

102

00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,288

Anyway,

why I've been calling

is because that thing we discussed?

 

103

00: 745,455 --> 00: 247,457

Well, I've been thinking...
104

00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:52,629

..-and I decided I can't do it. That's
probably not what you wanted to hear.

105

00% $52,795 == 00% 755,006

But hopefully you'll understand...

106

00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,301

...and if you want to talk more about it,
that's fine.

107

00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,719

So call me. I'm around.

108

00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,446

-Hey. Come on in.

-Hi.
109

00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,665

First, I wanna tell you that I get it.

110

00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:34,337

 

From what you've told me,

 

 

this situation

with Walt's gambling sounds...

112
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,718
Yeah, it definitely was.

113
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,972
And continues to be.

114
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:51,646
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just...

115
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,606
...help me out here.

116
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,985
Well, I've thought long and hard
about this...

17
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,614
-and here's what I want to do.

18
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,247
So is Walt gonna be okay?

19
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,124
Are you in contact with him?

20
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,209
He's fine.

21
00213313,376 ==" 002133 15,878
Good. That's good.

 

22
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,342
-He doesn't know about you offering--?
-No. Absolutely not.

00213¢21,509 --> 00:13:25,305
And I mean to keep it that way, so....

124
O0#13225,471. —-> 00s13: 32,434
Six hundred and seventeen

thousand dollars written out to me.

125
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,817
-What is this?
-I can't take your money.

126
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,488
-And why is that?
-Because, at the end of the day...

127
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,618
...paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings....

28
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50, 663
I don't know, it feels wrong.

29
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,665
"It feels wrong"?

30
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,625
To me it does.

 

31
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm not judging you or Walt. I'm
just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

 

 

132
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,092
Well, Ted, the whole reason
we're in this mess...

133
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,220
...is because you had me
cooking your books.

134
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:11,184
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem for you?

135
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,852
Now, hold on,
that was a one-time measure...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
136
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,564
..in an honest attempt
to protect my employees...

137
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,316
...and save my dad's company.

138
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,653
It might've been a mistake, but that's
no reason to go out and make another.

1.39
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,491
No, Ted, this is the big mistake,
right here.

140
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:32,455
You owe the federal government
$617,000. If you do not pay them...

...they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

142
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,339
And if they audit my business,
find out that Walt and I paid for it...

143
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45, 468
..with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings...

144
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:50,181
..we will go to prison, where you will
already be. Do you understand?

145
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,477
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

146
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,020
No one's going to prison.

Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

148
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:04,028
Okay, fine,
let's say I take your advice.

49
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,781
I pay the IRS. Then what?

50
00815: 06,948 => 00:15:09,283
hen you don't owe them.

H

51
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,578

Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler.

 

52
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,582
I'm still going to go bankrupt

and lose my business and my home.

153
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,460
I still have to pull my girls
out of school.

 

 

 

154

00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:24,465
Just because I pay some stupid fine
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

 

155
00715:26,426 --> 00:15:31,389
So if I'm understanding you
Correctly es «

56

00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,101

...you're saying you can't take
the money gave you...

57
00215:36,269 --> 00215: 38,896
...but you can take a larger amount.

 

58
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,774
No. I'm just saying...

159
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,111
...as much as I appreciate the gesture...

160
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,322
...the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

161
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,453
-Because it's not enough?
-No, no, don't twist my words.

162
O0%15753,619 ==> 0021.53 58,249
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

63

00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,714

-Ted, are you blackmailing me?
-What? No. Blackmailing?

64
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06, 674
God.

65
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:12,889
-I feel I'm not explaining things right.
-I think you're explaining it fine.

 

66

00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:24,567

I notice that this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

167
002165245775 == 00916228, 237
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

168
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,781
Now that you know,
you will be returning it.

169
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,202
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible...

-Skyler.
-Same amount.

It was just you and Joaquin.

Yeah, there's this industrial laundry

What laundry? What about it?

227
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,029
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

228
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,075
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

229
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:53,831
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

230
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,339
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

boy, that place seems ripe...

240
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,041
...for some kind
of clandestine activities.

241

I just don't want us to miss anything,

00227 219265 == 002275 25,352
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on it.

302
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,414
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, thanks.

303
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,749
What--? You just can't--

304
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,630
-What's this about?
-I'll tell you what this is about.

305
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,217
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

306
00227575926 == 002285 00,596
-Huell? Who's Huell?
-This is Huell.

307
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,141
-Huell, you happy?
-Reasonably.

308
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,059
What would make you unhappy?

309
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,729
This motherfucker
not doing what he's told.

310
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,232
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

311
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,902
I'm gonna say no.

312
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,572
Well, there you have it.

Let's go find your checkbook. Ready?

313
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,201
Here we go. All right?
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

314
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,495
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

315
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:32,377
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $617,226--

316
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,422
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Hold that thought.

317
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,760
Forgot to mention we know exactly how
much money is in your account, okay?

318
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,639
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

319
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:50,646
So $617,226 and 31 cents...

320
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,650
...made payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

321
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,069
What?

322
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,738
Wait, this’ is...?

323
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,783
-Skyler? Skyler White sent you?
-It doesn't matter.

00229202,950 --> 00:29:05,327
For now, all you have to do
is worry about that.

B25
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,412
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

326
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,207
Skyler is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

327
00229:10,374 ==> 00:29:13,001
Let me call her. We'll....

328
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,798
No, you're misunderstanding,

Mr. Beneke. Phone-call time is over.

329
002293 17,965 == 0022 95 21,009
-Check-writing time.
-Skyler would never do this to me.

 

330
00229:21,176 =—> 00:29:22,719
Sit down and write!

331
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,640
There you go.

332
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:34,064
Six hundred seventeen thousand,
two hundred twenty-six dollars...

333
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,899
..-and thirty-one....

334
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,068

Huell's happy.

338
00229:53,959 --> 00:29:57,963
All right. Everything else
has been filled out for you.

339
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,299
All's we need...

340

..is a signature...

341
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,096

Hard part is over.

344

Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

345
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,279
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

346
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,656
Way back,

I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

347
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,993
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV...

348
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,704

...for the next couple
of days until the check clears.

349
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,081
Painless, right?

350
002304 33,665 ==> 007303 35,959
Unless you don't have cable...

351
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,129
...in which case it's gonna suck, so....

352
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,552
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

353.
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,598
Nope.

Someone cooked here.

You've been out of commission
four days.

You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

Who cooked? Who was here?

358

I don't know how you're doing the flips.
Tell me.

All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.

I know that you have been cooking
without me.

So what?

Isn't it obvious to you
what Gus is planning?

He's going to use you to replace me.

387

you need me anymore.

You've got to help me. Please.

394
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,913
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

395
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,335
"I hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

-Here.

466
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,510
Okay.

467
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,055
This is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

468
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,725
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

 

 

 

469
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,852
You just call and leave a message.

470
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,189
You tell them
that you need a new dust filter...

471
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,359
...for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

472
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,070
I wrote it right on there.
He'll call you back.

473
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,198
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

474
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,367
The guy works fast. That's the game.

475
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:38,329
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

416
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,916
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

477
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,628
You gotta bring money. He doesn't
lift a finger unless he's paid.

478
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,171
Okay.

479
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,924
-Saul.

-Can't say it's been a pleasure--

 

 

480
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,427
I need you to do one more thing
for me.

481
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,178
You need to call the DEA.

482

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,931
You need to tell them Gus
has a hit out on Hank.

483
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:00,018
-You have to do it for me.
-I gotta go on living here.

484
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,521
-I'm way too comfortable in my--
-Just call anonymously.

485
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05, 648
-You call anonymously!
~— gan't!

486
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07, 692
I'm practically in the DEA family.

487
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11, 446
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

488
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,198
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do it for me.

489
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,701
-Please. Please.
-No.

490
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,329
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve
to die because of this.

491
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,874
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

492
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,835
-Okay.
-The most I'll go--

493
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,546

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I'll say it's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

494
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,925
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to....

495
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,387
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

496
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:41,184
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

497
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,102
Yeah.

498
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,147
Thank you, Saul.

499
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,141
No, no, no.

500
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,852
Where's the rest?

501
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,315
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

502
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,320
-Walt?
-Down here!

503
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,993
Walt, what did that phone call mean?

504
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,371
Where is it?

00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,249

Where's the rest?

506
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,627
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

507
002434514212 == 002433 53,506
Skyler, where is the money?

508
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,765
I gave it to Ted.

509
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,392
What?

510
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,980
-You did what?
-Walt, I had to.

511
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,773
For us, for the family.

512
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12, 608
I swear, Walt--

513
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,153
You gave our money to Beneke?

 

514
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,616
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

515
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,751
Walt.

5.16
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,423
Walt.

517
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,139
Walt.

 

518
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:58,070
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

519
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,198
Skyler.

520
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02, 867
It's happening again.

521
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,538
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

522
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,208
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

523)
00452 11,292 => 00:45:13,252
Oh, God.

524
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:20,009
They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.

525
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,094
Oh, God.

526
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,223
When is this going to end?

00245427,934 =—> 00245: 30,019
Marie, I'm here.

Hi
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,159
They're here, out front.

2
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,495
-How many?
-Nelson Brey, three others.

3
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,038
-His toothbrush?
-Got it.

4
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,414
What about your stuff?

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,709
Oh, we'll talk to them
about stopping at your place.

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44, 962
Skyler. Skyler.

7
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46, 338
-What?
-I'm not going.

8
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,049
-What?
-I'm not going to Hank and Marie's.

9
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,011
-We're in danger.
-Yes, that's true. Because of me.

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,763
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,349
All that matters
is the rest of you are safe.

12
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,352
And that's why

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I'm not going with you.

13
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,687
I'm the real target.

14
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,940
-But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
-No, no, no.

15
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,776
No one will be safe at Hank's
if I'm there.

6
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,571
Walt, it's the DEA.

00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,990
Skyler, you don't know these people.

8
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,575

-No. Skyler, please.

 

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,244
Trust me. This is how it has to be.

 

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,747
Those agents outside.

They're not gonna just leave you here.

 

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,499
It's protective custody.

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,461
All they know is that Hank
is the only person that's in danger.

 

 

23
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,048
They're including us as a courtesy
to Marie, to keep her happy.

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:35,387

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

How am I supposed to explain that
to Marie or Junior? Or Hank?

25
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,055
I don't know.

26
00201437,222 --> 00701: 39,433
But you'll do it. You'll figure it out.

27
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,604
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,732
Except she's not.

29
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,904
I'll talk to Hank. You just back me up
with everyone else.

30
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,534
You really expect me to say,

"Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and"....

31
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,703
No.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,747
There's gotta be another way.

33.
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,041
There isn't.

34
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,752
There was.

35
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,296
But now there isn't.

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13, 634
Walt...
37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,136
..-how long till you're safe?

38
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,805
Till you can work this out?

39
00202221,975 --> 00702: 23,977
Oh, Skyler.

40
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,771
No.

41
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,731
-Skyler.
-No.

42
00#022.28,231. <> 002022 32,069
I have lived under the threat of death
for a year now.

43
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:36,782
And because of that,
I've made choices.

44
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,909
-I--
-Listen to me.

45
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:44,581
I alone should suffer the consequences
of those choices, no one else.

46
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,042
And those consequences...

47
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,420
...they're coming.

48
002.02:53, 7157 =—> 00:02:56,885
No more prolonging the inevitable.

Feed that belt through
those seatbelt holders.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,649
Hank, I've got a car wash to run.

51
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,278
I mean, you don't honestly believe
that I'm in danger, do you? Me?

52
00#03215,445 => 00:03: 20,075
Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a
lead balloon. It'll be Marie that kills me.

53
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,412
Well, just know that I'll get there
as soon as I can.

54
00203423,578 ==> 00203227,082
And let Steve Gomez know.
I told his guys.

55
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,208
And just stay safe.

56
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,170
Oh, please.

Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.

57
00%03232,337 ==> 003033 36, 633
Yeah, yeah. But keep your head down
anyway, all right?

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,385
All right.

59
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,929
All right, buddy. Take care.

60
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,482
I know.

61
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,215
Okay, sweetie.

62
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,011
Okay, my love. Okay. Okay.

63
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,141
Okay, my darling. It's okay.

64
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,226
We're all right.

65
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,312
Okay.

66
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,666
He's gonna risk his life
over a stupid car wash?

67
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,586
Does he understand
what's going on with Uncle Hank?

68
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,463
He'll come when he's able.

69
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,798
That's pathetic. I--

70
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,676
How hard did you even try
or did you?

71
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,221
-Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom.
-Well, you know, Hank...

72
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,851
..we wouldn't be arguing about this if
you and Steve would make him come.

73

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,853
Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

74
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,231
-It's not Nazi Germany, all right?
-Oh, you-- Nazi Germany.

75
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,194
If I had a dollar for every time
I heard that. I'm gonna call him.

76
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,531
He's gonna get his behind
here immediately. End of story.

77
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,076
Thank you.
At least somebody is listening.

78
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,829
-Because we are all in danger here.
-We're not all in danger here.

79
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,959
Will you stop saying that?
That is asking for trouble.

80
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,169
Come on, Walt.

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47, 926
He's not picking up.

82
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,346
Look, could we just take this down
a notch, okay? Everybody?

83
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,974
You guys can stay here
as long as you like.

84
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55, 392

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

We got plenty of room.

85
00:07:55,558 --> 00:08:00,188
I wouldn't worry about any danger
to Walt or any of us, okay?

86
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,857
This whole thing
is just a damn smoke screen.

87
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,070
-How do you mean "a smoke screen"?
-An anonymous threat against me?

88
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,864
I'm stuck in a wheelchair,
I'm not even on the job.

89
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,952
No, someone didn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

90
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,037
What? Minerals?

91
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,002
Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?

92
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,837
I start looking...

93
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,009
..-into Fring, all of a sudden
I'm on lockdown for my protection?

94
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,969
-Gus Fring?
-Did you say--?

Hank, what are you talking about?

97
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,477
Just one man's humble opinion,
that's all.

98
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,855
I think Los Pollos Hermanos
is a front...

99
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,108
..-for the biggest meth distributor
in the Southwest.

100
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48, 820
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Steve, are you even looking into this?

101
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,657
We're looking into everything.
But we work on fact, not conjecture.

102
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,495
And the fact is that the scumbags
that hit you first were Mexican cartel...

03
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,290
...not some German multinational
whatever.

04
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,167
Definitely not Colonel Sanders.

05
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,502
Now, if we even had a shred of proof--

 

06

00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,921

Isn't that what you get paid
to go get?

107

Well, he says he's a chef.

130
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,011
Because you work at a restaurant
that charges $14 for a burger...

00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,431

Makes you a burger-flipper.

-Least in my book.
-Yeah.

133
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,436
Anyway, so we bust this chef,
heroin possession.

134
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,398
He says, "Just because
you found heroin in my chef whites...

135

136

I'll say it for you.

His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

We're gonna find heroin here
like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.

141
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,333
Right?

142
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,297
The thing is that this chef's daddy

143

I'm not gonna tell which one,
but you know who he is.

144

So now I gotta waste my time
checking out this burger-flipper's story.

Listen, I have to check
on my boss.

253
00:21
Sure.

254

Okay.

255

00:21:

Is it okay
if I come out here for a few minutes?

247,556

if you would.

49,183

21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,528

Excuse me.

256

22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,656
I wonder if you have a--

257

An extra cigarette.

22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,492
I sure could use a smoke

238

right about now.

258

06,659 --> 00:22:

Sure.

259

11,705 --> 00:22:

Thank you.

260

19,004 --> 00:22:

Thanks.

261

258,252 --> 00:23:

Hey, what's up?
262

02,590 ==> 00323%
What?
263

04,049 --> 00:23:

Hey. Hey.

264

20,756

00,754

03,883

06,802
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,055
What's wrong with him?

265
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,767
What hospital?

266
002233 17,855 == 002235 19,3815
Andrea.

267
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,941
Jesse.

268
002233 21,108 == 002235 23,569
-Where's Brock?
-Inside. Grandma's with him.

269
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,948
-They got me filling all this paperwork.
-How is he doing? Tell me.

270
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,993
The doctors,
they don't know what it is exactly.

271
002233 31,160 ==> 00723: 34,246
It's like he's got the flu.

272
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,083
But he just keeps getting worse.

273
002233 40,252 ==> 00723: 43,839
Jesse, I don't understand.

274
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,008
He was fine this morning.

275
002233 47,259 ==> 00223: 50,179
He was fine.

276
00223: 53,223 => 00:28: 55,225

Miss Cantillo, we're gonna go
admit your son to the Pediatric ICU.

278
00223:59,772 => 00:24:01,941
-You can bring that with you.
-Okay.

279
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,652
-Sir, you're the boy's father?
-No.

280
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,364
Okay. Sorry. It's just we try to keep it
to two visitors maximum.

281
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,159
Go, go, go. I'll be out here
if you need me. Go. Go ahead.

282
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,189
No.

No, no.

284
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,860
No. No. No.

285

Come on. Come on.

286
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,116
Come on.

287
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,660
No. No!

290
00:25:10,342 =--> 00:25:12,177
-Hey. No yelling.
-I need to--

291
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,930
-We can't have you here.
-I need to talk to her.

292
00:25:15,097 =-> 00:25:17,558
-I need to tell her--
-Take this outside.

293

-My son is sick in here.
-No, just-- Come here.

Jesse....

295
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,481
What is it?

296
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,359
Jesse, I can't go out.
My son's in here.

297
00825427,525 ==> 003251382,322
Okay. I'm thinking Brock
may have been poisoned, okay?

298
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,657
What?

299
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:37,286
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

300
008253 37,453 => 00:25:40,538
Sounds like rice. You need
to tell the doctors about it.

301
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,249
What? How do you know?

302
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,543
Doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess. Okay?

303
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,297
Ricin.
They'll know what you're talking about.

304
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:52,176
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying, you have to tell me.

305
00825: 52,342 => 00:25254,303
I gotta go. I gotta go see someone.

306
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,305
-Jesse.
-I'm sorry, I gotta go.

307
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,057
Just tell them, okay?

308
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,225
Now. Just do it.

309
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,273
Hello. Could you buzz me in, please?

310
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,525
Buzz me in!

31.
00226: 37,179 ==> 00926338, 931

the desert.

my head...

323.
24,893 --> 00:27:27,479

...and drove me out into the desert

00:27:
They

on my knees.

324
27,645 --> 00:27:31,400
threatened my family,

My wife, my children.

It's just a matter of time now.

327
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:51,420
I was able to protect them for now,
but....

328
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,967
Gus is gonna make his move.

329
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,942
And I don't-- I don't know when.

330
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,905
I don't know where or how.

331
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,576
All I know is it's gonna happen.

332
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,418
And I'm powerless to stop him.

333
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,966
What are you doing?

334
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,387
Why did you do it?

335
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,431
-Why?
-Jesse.

336
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,975
Gus gave me no choice.

337
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,812
I had to call the DEA to protect
my family. What else could I do--?

Okay, look, just--

340
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,445
Just put the gun down, okay?

341
00828: 58,612 => 00:29: 01, 281
Just put it down and we'll talk,
all right?

342
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,451
You tell me
what it is you think I did.

343
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,827
Brock.

344
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,246
Why did you poison him?

345
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,457
-Who's Brock?
-You saw him in my living room.

346
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,795
You came and you looked right at him,
so don't tell me you don't know him.

347
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,713
The boy?

348

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,217
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

Okay,
that's Brock and he was poisoned?

35.1
00220225, 555 <> 00:29: 27,099
The ricin.

352
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,852
He's dying because someone gave it
to him.

353
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,983
And only you and I were the only two
people on earth who knew about it.

354
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,734
No, wait a minute.

355
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,487
Wait a minute.
Maybe he went into your pockets--

356
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,864
No! I had it.

357
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,702
I had the cigarette with the ricin
in my pack this morning.

358
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,329
The last time I saw Brock
was last night.

359
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,708
And this morning, I switched
the cigarette into a new pack.

360
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,918
There's no way Brock took it himself.

361

You said it yourself

When could I have possibly

00:30:03,010
You had

00:30:05,512

gotten it?

364

365

-What?
~Yeah.

366

00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:
I went to his office.

Yeah.

367

00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:

had to see me today.

00:30:

He called me in,

Saul do it.

His big bodyguard patted me down.

00:30:

369
3,437 --> 00:30:

That's when he must have

002303

off me. Right?

370

 

6,773 --> 00:30:

That's the plan? Was that

00:30:21,403 --> 00:30

00:30:23,488 --> 00:30

371
Jesse.
372
Why?

373

6,356
stoke it

 

9,443
the plan?

22,988

25,073

00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:30,454

Why in God's name

would I poison a child?

Because I'm helping Gus...

376
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:40,589
...and this is your way of ripping my
heart out before you're dead and gone.

Just admit it.

Admit what you did. Admit it.

379
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,388
-I did not do this!
-Shut up!

children to be murdered?

Gus.

He has

been 10 steps ahead of me
at every turn.

397

that he needed to finally get rid of me...

the one thing

And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it.

And not only does he have that...

400
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,806
...he manipulated you
into pulling the trigger for him.

401

No, only you and I

Please.

You're his cook now.

You're the cook and you have proven
that you can run a lab without me.

414

And now that cook
has reason to kill me.

00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,235
...then go...

421
008332 07,903 => 00:33712, 991
..-put a bullet in my head
and kill me right now.

422
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,162
-I'll do it.
-Do it!

“I'll do it.

424
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,334
Do it.

425
00333323, 919 =--> 00°33% 25,587
Do it.

426
002332 55,116 => 00:33: 57, 786
-Where are you going?
-Find the son of a bitch...

427
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,746
..-and I'm gonna kill him.
-No.

428
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,748
Don't.

429
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,000
He'll see you coming.

430
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,340
You'll die
before you get anywhere near him.

431
002342: 10,507 --> 00:34711,591
I don't: care.

432
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,426
Jesse.

433
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,263
Jesse, just get in your car.

434
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,806
Just go.

435
00734:17,973 =--> 00:34:19,891
Just drive.

436
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,018
No.

437
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,981
I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

438
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,652
Then let me help.

439
00234:59,055 ==> 00:35: 03,810
Jesus. Mr. Pinkman,
I'm not gonna keep telling you.

440
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,814

Unless the family wants you in there,

you're not allowed.

441
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,026
You can't keep coming in here
like this.

442
00235411,192 --> 00:35:12,819
You hear me?

443
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,571
You understand?

444
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,241

Mr. Pinkman, I'm gonna call security.

445
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,786
All right, here I go.

446
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,459
Come on now.

447
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,589
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

448
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,577
Hey.

449
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,582
You need to be at work, now.

450
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,294
I already told you. I'm not going.

451
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,424
Got a batch that'll be ruined...

452
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,512
..-and an employer who will be
very upset if that happens.

453
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,140
And I could give a shit.

454
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,101
I'm not leaving here.

455
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,022
If my employer has a problem with that,
he can tell me himself.

456
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,191
Not his errand boy.

457
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,197
Idiot.

458
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,617
Hey, I don't know this guy.

459
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,371
Call security. I'm being attacked.

460
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,169
Yeah.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
461
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,797
That's right.

462
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,063
We've got a situation.

463
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,474
He'd like to speak with you.

464
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,435
I told you, I'm not leaving.

465
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,855
He's downstairs.

 

466
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,330
Tyrus told me what's happening.

467
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,709
The sick child.

468
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:44,632
I understand your preoccupation,
but, Jesse, I am running a business.

469
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,386
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

470
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,140
You can return when you're done.

471
00239; 53,641. => 00:39:55,518
I can"t..

472
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,440
It is, as you must know,
in both of our best interests.

473
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,905
That little boy upstairs is dying.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
474
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,618
I can't be away.
I don't even wanna be here now.

475
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,329
I can't be away,
if something happens, if he--

476
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,081
I am very sorry.

477
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,376
Is there anything I can do?

478
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,046
I am on the board of this hospital.

479
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,715
I can recommend doctors...

480
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,635
...make sure he gets
whatever he needs.

481
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,345
The best treatment.

482
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,599
He's not sick.

483
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,144
He was poisoned.

484
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,982
How did that happen?

485
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,570
The doctors...

What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,112
-Because he's on to us. Yeah.
-What do you mean he's on to us?

3
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,282
He's walking to his car,
then suddenly he isn't.

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,284
What, does he have a sixth sense?

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,202
Jesus. What did you say to him?

6
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,789
Could I ask my own question right now
at this point?

7
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,458
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

8
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,920
What, was I supposed to leave it
on his car?

9
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,840
What, you're supposed to bring it
to a hospital?

10
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,883
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,343
Look.

12
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,721
Where can we find Gus?

Well,

25

Jesse Pinkman?
26
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,559
~Yeah.
-Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.

27
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,020
Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

28
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:29,232
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes. Go someplace and talk.

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,484
About what?

30
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,278
-Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
-About what?

31
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,155
It concerns Brock Cantillo...

32
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,616
...and a statement you made
to his mother.

33
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39, 368
How about you come with us?

34
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,579
We just wanna clear a few things up,
no big deal.

35
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,412
-So am I under arrest?
-No, you're not under arrest.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,746
We're just talking.

37
00#03.24,.913 <-> 00:03327, 958
So if I get tired of talking,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
can I get up and leave?

38
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,460
We'd prefer you didn't.

39
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,170
-You'd prefer.
-Yeah.

40
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,675
Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

41
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:42,347
Look, I think this has been,
you know...

42
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,975
...what do call it? Overblown.

43
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,977
Because all I basically said was:

44
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:51,314
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,442
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

46
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57, 696
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
You helping them out like that.

47
00203:57,863 =-> 00:03:59,781
Especially how specific you were.

48
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01, 908
Ricin, wow.

49
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05, 620
Ricin, that's definitely a big one.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
You don't see that every day.

50
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,040
So when doctors hear that,
they take it very seriously.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,084
As do we.

52
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,254
-As does the FBI.
-Okay.

53
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,048
Nice, you trying to help out
like that and all.

54
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,344
You know, professional courtesy,
sharing your expertise.

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,974
Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
I just, you know--

56
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,435
You happened
to guess this rare poison...

57
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,813
..-might be the thing
that put this boy in the hospital.

58
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,276
Congratulations. Because his doctors,
they think that you might just be right.

59
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,738
So why ricin?
Jesse, how'd you come up with that?

60
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,826
I think I've-- I don't know, I must've

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

saw it on House or something.

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,122
Yeah, you know, like, House
or the Discovery Channel.

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,209
Sometimes your brain
just makes these connections.

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,211
-Does it?
-Mine does.

64
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,129
That's interesting.

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,840
Look, I gotta get back.

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,218
But we're still talking.

67
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,764
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

68
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,893
So then, I guess...

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,395

-I should call my lawyer, right?

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,524
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

71
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,443
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,112
You know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

73
00205321,.279 => 00:05:23,657
Suddenly,
everything's a big pissing match.

74
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,951
-Like, every time.

Is he here?

86

Is that a serious question?
Why would he be here?

I need a number.

Now, I apologize profusely.

Get over here. No more excuses.

-Yeah?
-I have this guy down at the office.

He says he has some kind
of information.

His nurse calls us,

than the office.

Things have slowed to a crawl
at the Big I, no surprises there either.

403
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,779
Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley...

404
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,782
...an explosion has been reported
at a nursing home.

405
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,992
-Casa Tranquila nursing home.
-Oh, no.

406
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,246
You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.

407
002382 51,412 => 00:38:56,292
Unfortunately, initial report is though,
that three people may have been killed.

408
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,419
-Oh, no.
-The news is disturbing.

409
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01, 631
We're gonna get you information
as soon as it comes in.

410
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05, 468
Situation over there is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like?

411
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,887
If you're moving through that area...

412

00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,724
..we're talking about East and
Westbound Paseo, North Valley.

413
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,477
Please, avoid that area
as you move through.

414
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:19,065
Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.

415
00%39719,232 s=> 0023.93 22,902
Coming up on Coyote 102.5,
Aerosmith, Def Leppard.

416
002:39:323,069 => 00:39:25,655
Keep it right here
on New Mexico's finest rock--

417
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,234
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

418
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,238
Next step, CO2.

 

419
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,990
Do it.

420
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,259
Hey.

421
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,511
I better hear them click.

422
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,287
What, you got a problem with stairs?

423
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,287
Gus is dead.

424
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,670

We've got work to do.

425
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,839
He's gonna pull through.

426
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,507
Yeah?

427
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:42,180
Yeah. It looked kind of touch-and-go
there for a while...

428
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,182
...but he's gonna....

429
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,268
He's gonna make it.

430
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,104
Oh, thank God.

431
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,107
Oh, thank God.

432
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,911
You know,

still saying it wasn't the ricin.

433
00245: 07,413 => 002452709,.123
I don't understand.

434
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,125
Then what was it?

435
00745:11,292 =-> 00:45:17,173
Saying it was most likely a flower
called lily of the valley.

436
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,842
It's, like, common.

00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,596
It's got these red berries on it
that I guess taste sweet...

438
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,266
...and sometimes kids eat them
and wind up poisoning themselves.

439
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,478
And that's it, nothing more.

440
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:39,028
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

441
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:49,372
Still he had to go...

442
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,040
«right?

443
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,211
Damn right.

444
00245: 55,378 => 00:45:57,505
Gus had to go.

445
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,633
Yeah.

446
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,848
You know, I should--

447
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09, 684
I should get back.

448
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,852
Andrea's waiting.

449
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,277
I'm at Casa Tranquila
where three are dead...
450
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,281
..-following an explosion

that rocked this facility earlier today.

451
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,284
The fireball completely consumed
one resident's room...

452
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,328
...and damaged common areas
nearby.

453
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,537
Walt?

454
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,998
Let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

455
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,043
-Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
-Walt?

456
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,377
How you doing?

457
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,629
How am I doing? How are you doing?

 

458
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,548
I'm....

459
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,303
I'm doing quite well.

460
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,473
I'm good.
461

00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,559
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

462

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,269
Gus Fring is dead.

463
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,315
He was blown up with some person
from some Mexican cartel...

464
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,318
...and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

465
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,446
Do you know about this?

466
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,825
-Walt? I need you to--
-It's over.

467
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,452
We're safe.

468
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,121
--might've heard a rumbling sound...

469
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,084
...and another reported a, quote,
"ringing" in the moments just prior.

470
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,503
Administrators
at Casa Tranquila advise...

471
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:05,257
...that if you do have loved ones

in their care, please do not call in....

472
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,343
Was this you?

473
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,847
What happened?
