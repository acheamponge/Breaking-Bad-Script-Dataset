00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,880
Here you go.

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,953
What happened there?

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,917
-It's my birthday.
-Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

4
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46, 838
Birthday meals are free at Denny's.
All you gotta show is a valid ID.

5
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,590
I'm good. Thanks.

6
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,051
Really? Free meal. Free is good.

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,014
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,267
Thank you.

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59, 643
Okay.

10
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,028
New Hampshire.
You're a long way from home.

1
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,446
How long a drive is that?

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,492
About 30 hours,
if all you stop for is gas.

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,578
You headed to California?

4
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,247
No. Here.

5
-> 00:01:23,083
Okay.

00201 4.214.290

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,002
So, what's here?

7
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,342
Business.
8

 

 

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,138
You know, I was in Boston once. Boston
and a little town called Swampscott...

 

9
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,765
..-which is right outside of Boston.

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,310
That's kind of near
New Hampshire, right?

21
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,939
Yeah. More or less.

22
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,942
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,237
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

24
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,574
Yeah. Great science museum there.

25
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,578
Excuse me.

00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,706
-Hi.
-Hi.

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,708
My name's Lucy. I'll be your server.

28
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,564
I got your word this won't wind up
crossing the border?

29
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,193
It's never leaving town.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,156
Is there a manual? Instruction manual?

oi
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,158
I pulled something off the Internet.

32
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,077
It's in there.

33
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,788
Well...

34
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44, 998
...good luck, I guess.

35
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,955
Happy birthday, Mr. Lambert.

36
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,075
Jesus, Walt, the news here....
Gus Fring is dead.

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,788
He was blown up along with some person
from some Mexican cartel...

38

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,917
..and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

39
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,419
Do you know about this?

40
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,464
Walt?

41
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,802
Walt, I need you to--

42
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,180
It's over. We're safe.

43
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,032
Was this you?

44
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,955
What happened?

45
00205: 31,623 => 00:05: 33,458
I won.

46
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,575
Oh, God.

47
00#07218,772 <> 00:07: 20,354
Dad.

48
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,192
-Dad.
-Hey.

49
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,653
Hey.

50
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,114
Serious-- You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
51
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,575
No, sorry, I....

52
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,162
You didn't tell him about Mr. Fring?

53
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,123
-He knows.
-Welcome home.

54
00207:37,290 ==> 00:07:41, 711
Jesus, Dad, it's all they're talking about.

55
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,381
They haven't said it on TV yet...

56
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,717
...but Uncle Hank says he was
this major, major drug dealer.

57
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,221
I mean, like, holy shit.

58
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,766
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

59
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,352
Uncle Hank was
after this guy all along.

60
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,813
He didn't tell us, but he was.

61
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,565
He even took me
to his restaurant one time...

62
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,527
..-jJust, like, totally toying
with the guy...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
63
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,530
...just like, "I got my eye on you."
Like that.

64
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:13,493
They figure Mr. Fring was the one
who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.

65
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,122
Just somebody got to him first.

66
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,707
Yeah, wow.

67
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,209
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.

68
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:26,548
She didn't want us to leave,
but Mom figured it was time.

69
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:33,513
There's still some agents over there,
but they figure it's over.

70
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,141
Like, when this hits the news...

71
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,810
...Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.

72
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,896
-Yeah.
-I mean, even more so than before.

13
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,107
Seriously.

74
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,067
See-- See if it's on TV.

00:08:46,234

Yeah, yeah,

00:08:48,611

Just give me a couple minutes,

00:08:50,572

--> 00:08:48,445
I want to.

76
--> 00:08:50,405

77
--> 00:08:53,158

--around the 24-yard-line.
They break huddle--

00:09:02,709

00:09:04, 961

00:09:11, 384
Hi,
00:09:13,219

78
--> 00:09:04,085
Hi.

719
--> 00:09:06,546
Hi.

80
--> 00:09:13,053

sweet pea.

81
--> 00:09:15,847

Oh, Daddy missed you so much.

 

00:09:17,849
Yes,
00:09:19,726
I

00:09:22,020

82
==> 007092 19,559.
he did.

83
--> 00:09:21,644
know.

84
=—> 00:09: 23, 813

I missed you too.

00:09:29,152
Well,
I rate a

00:09:35,700

85
--> 00:09:33,114

don't you think
"hello,"

at least?

86
--> 00:09:37,202

Hello.

00:09:42,999

87
--> 00:09:45,085

Hello to you too.

88

huh?
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,674
So are you gonna talk to me here?

89
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,302
Are you gonna....

90
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,763
You gonna show some kind of....

91
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:02,060
I don't know, some kind of mild relief
that I'm alive?

92
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,064
I am relieved, Walt.

93
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,609
And scared.

94
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,570
Scared?

95
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,989
Scared of what?

96
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,120
You.

97
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,087
Hey.

98
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,342
Hi.

99
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,744
Oh, Shit.

100
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,452
Jesus, just say it already.

LOA,
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,038

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Tell me "I told you so."
Get it out of your system...

102
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,541
...before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

103
00212:30,875 --> 00:12:33,920
It's exactly like Boetticher's drawings.

104
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,674
Where were the two bodies?

105
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,219
Over by the freight elevator.
Over there.

106
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,183
-No idea who they were?
-No, not much left.

107
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,853
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot...

08
00212 251,020 ==> 00212252, 647
...SO they tell me.

09
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,858
Whoever torched it did it up right.

10
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,782
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

11
00213: 15,670 => 00. 13317, 171
What do you figure that was?

 

12
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,134
I don't know,
some kind of lab equipment?

 

 

113
00213327,765 =-> 00%13329, 934

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Maybe a camera?

114
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,119
Come on. Come on, you, be nice.
Be nice.

5
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,788
Come on. Hey. Hey!

6
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,790
You be nice. Just be nice.

7
00213352,057 == 002133 54,792
Let Wendell in there.

8
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,129
If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.

 

9
00213358,296 == 00813: 59,756
Yeah.

20
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,312
It's Gustavo.

21,
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,523
He's dead.
22

00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,143
Son of a bitch.

23
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,688
Son of a bitch.

 

 

24
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,733
-Hold up! Hold up!

-Get out of my way, kid.

 

 

125
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,655
-Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.
-I am done listening to this asshole talk.

126

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
002153 05,822 ==> 00215: 07,365
Now get out of my way.

127
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,742
He's got something you need to hear,
all right?

128
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,203
What'd you do, Jesse?
Do you even know?

12.9
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,247
Do you even know what you've done?

130
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,916
-Yeah, he saved his own life--
-One more word.

31
00815¢17,083 s=> 0031.53 19,001
Mike. Mike.

32

00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,047

If you kill him, you're gonna
have to kill me. Come on.

33
002153245632 ==— 00215: 27,093
Oh, Jesse.

34
00#15:27,552 ==> 0031.5: 29,554
Jesus.

35
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,890
What is it with you guys?

36
00215): 33,099 ==> 001.5: 35,:601.
Honest to God.

 

37
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,104
May I?
38

 

 

00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,152
Look, whatever differences

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

you and I have, they'll keep.

139
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,737
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

140
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,825
-Bigger fish.
-The video cameras.

141
00:15:50,992 =-> 00:15:53,578
Gus kept cameras on us at the lab...

142
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,497
...at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

143
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,459
And of course, when I say "us,"
I'm including you.

44
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,294
Mike.

45
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03, 963
Mike, if he taped all that shit...

46
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,674
-us cooking, you picking up....

 

47
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,178
If Gus had a record of that

 

 

and the police get to it before we do....

148
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,471
You son of a bitch.

149
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15, 683
Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,
or a hard drive.

150
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17, 643

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Where?

51
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,103
Where did he keep it?

52
00316:22,273 =-> 00:16:25,359
He had a laptop in his office.

53
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28, 362
Kept it in the back of the restaurant.

54
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,782
It all fed straight to there.

55
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,500
What?

56
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,710
Keys, scumbag.

57
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,380
It's the universal symbol for keys.

 

58
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,412
Meter fraud.
And yes, yes, it's a big deal.

159
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:23, 668
Guy rigs his meter so he's paying
2 cents less for first-class postage.

 

160
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,130
I'm here to tell you that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

 

161
00%177428,297 => 00217%382,385
It's money out of your pocket,
it's money out of my pocket.

162
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,763
I was hoping-- Now, look, sarge.

163

--> 00:17:39,725

Do you think we could work together on
this thing? You folks have it over there?

 

 

 

 

64
00#17:39,892 => 00s17: 42,270
Could you tell me that, at least?
65
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,857

-What about a magnet?

-Who said "bomb"? I said "a device."
-What about a magnet?

217

An incendiary device.
One quick fire is all it would take.

I'm talking about halon.
Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.

-A magnet, though, maybe like--
-A bomb then. We plant a bomb outside.

00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,838
Ted Beneke. I'm a friend of his.

00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,007
But if it's not a good time, I could--

334
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,385
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up. Come on in.

335
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,442
Hey, Ted.

336
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,404
I tell you, he's been a real champ.

337
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,907
His color's better
and his blood pressure's up.

338
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,910
We are gonna have you
eating solid food in a day or two...

339
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,578
...I bet you money.

340
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,748
That's wonderful.

341
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,834
All right, I'm just down the hall.

342
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,264
Ted.

343
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,725
Can you hear me?

344
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,481
Yes.

345
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,736

I tripped...

Good.

363
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,564
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

364
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,859
We'll do a loop and come around
the other side. Turn here.

3865
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,039
Right up there.

366
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,292
That's the wall.

367
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,587
What the hell is this?
There's some big-ass hump in the way.

368
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,214
So? Just drive over it.

369
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,967
-All right.

-Come on, you can do it.

370
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,845
Take it easy. Take it easy.

371

00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,981
Cut it.

373
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,319
It's, like, 8 feet away. Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

374
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,528
It'll work.

-Let's just go!
-Hang on.

377
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,784
Mr. White, let's get out of here.

378
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,079
Just one minute.

You left the truck behind.

-So what?
-"So what"?

386
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,382
So what if they find prints?

387
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,594
And what if they trace it back
to the wrecking yard?

388
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,387
They won't.
389

00235739,554 ==> 00335: 41,514
There's no prints, I made sure of that.

390
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:45,352
There's no paperwork on the truck,
the magnet or the batteries.

391
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,188
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

392
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,814
I made sure of that too.

393
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,816
Well, you got all the answers.

394
00235: 51,983 =-> 00:35:55, 695
So you tell me, Answer Man,
did all that even work just now?

395
00:35:55,862 --> 00°35: 58,657
Yes. It worked.

396
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,159

And I'm supposed to take that on faith?

397
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,245
Yeah? And why?

398
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,830
How do we know?

399
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,959

Damaged.

412
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,742
The glass is broken...

413
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,077
...and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

414
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,706
Bag appears to be slightly punctured
by broken glass.

415
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,418
Check it out.

416
00237:35,420 =-> 00:37:37,005
That's not on the manifest.

 

417
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,676
All right, so first off,
I'm not a marriage counselor.

418
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,553
Nor do I take sides in this thing.

419
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,638
And, not taking sides, mind you...

420
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,057
...but you did put her in charge
of your money...

421
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,852
..which I advised against,
if you'll recall...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
422
00337251, 019 --> 00°37% 53,897
...all of which is not to be construed
as an "I told you so."

423
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,735
I'm just walking you through
my mental process, so to speak.

424
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,157
So she comes to me with a problem.

425
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,660
That she's been cooking Beneke's books,
he's in Dutch with the IRS...

426
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,164
...and once they audit,
it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.

427
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,335
To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

428
00238315,502 ==> 00738% 18,213
To which she says,
"No, let's cut Beneke a check...

429
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,632
...so's he can pay off the IRS."

430
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:25,345
Again, not taking sides,
but she really was trying to protect you.

431
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,350
A little feedback here might be nice.

432
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,563
"Let's involve Walt in this discussion."

433
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,733

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Yeah, that's what I told her.
She said no.

434
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,110
And you didn't argue the point.

435
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,154
You didn't think to contact me.

436
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,369
You were a tad preoccupied at the time,
if you'll recall.

437
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:53,957
Okay. So you took it upon yourself...

438
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,837
...to give away $622,000
of my money...

439
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,715
...to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

440
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,594
She's my client, same as you.

441
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,639
Does this arrangement
get a little tricky at times?

442
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,890
Absolutely.

443
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,060
But I try my best, you know,
ethically, in my duty--

444
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,020
Ethically?

445
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,315

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I'm sorry. I must be hearing things.

446
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:24,320
Did you actually just use
the word "ethically" in a sentence?

447
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,656
You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.

448
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,576
You're a two-bit bus-bench lawyer.

449
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,077
And you work for me.

450
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,539
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow
never had a client like you ask him...

451
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,457
...for something...

452
00239:37,166 =--—> 00:39:38,209
wees Like thibs..

453
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,671
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

454
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,256
Huell too.

455
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,843
He's got fingers like hot dogs.
He could've easily busted this in two...

456
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,929
...and killed everyone in the office.
But do I complain?

457
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,640
No. Beg, borrow or steal,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I'm your huckleberry.

458
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,184
I go the extra mile.

459
00:39:55,894 --> 00:40:00,189
Only you never told me
that kid would wind up in the hospital.

460
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,275
You know--

461
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,777
Take that thing
and get the hell out of here.

462
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,280
You and me, we're done.

463
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,922
What are you...?

464
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,506
Come on. Hey.

465
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,342
Hey.

466
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,060
We're done when I say we're done.

467
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,596
Yes, you are. Yes.

468
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,853
Hey.

469
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,487
I heard what happened to Ted.

470
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,074

He's not gonna talk.

471

Honey mustard.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,215
As per the Research Department...

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,091
...this is our sweeter formulation...

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,760
...for the American Midwest.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,764
While we've upped its Brix number
by 14 percent...

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,351
..we in fact use 2.2 percent
less honey...

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,064
...and make up the balance
with high-fructose corn syrup.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,900
We're quite pleased with the result.

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,528
This one is a new concept...

0
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,530
...and it intrigues us--

1
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,325
Half French dressing, half ranch.

2
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,202
We refer to it simply as...

«os"Franch."

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,873
Though perhaps our friends
in the Marketing Department...

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,042
..will see fit to come up
with a more catchy....

6
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,173
Any thoughts on the Franch?

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,092
Is it perhaps too...?

8
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,720
Cajun Kick-Ass.

 

9
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55, 847
This again is a reformulation...

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,476
...designed to alleviate the potential

That last one is essentially
just ketchup.

Mr. Schuler, they're back.

00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,610

Tell them I'll be with them shortly.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,828
Thank you, Ms. Tromel.

Mr. Schuler? Are you in there?

33
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,472
Yes, Ms. Tromel.

I'm sorry, sir--

35
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,725
These men...

36
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29, 603
.they're really rather insistent.

37
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,025
Mr. Schuler?

38
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,530
Mr. Schuler,
this is Chief Inspector Kunst.

39
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,199

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I'd like a word, please.

40
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,077
Would you step out of the washroom?

41
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,335
Mr. Schuler, open this door.

42
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,754
Now, Mr. Schuler.

43
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,467
Open up.

44
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,305
Mr. Schuler!

45
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,508
Honest to God,
it's starting to drive me crazy.

46
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,051
-Don't.
-It keeps me awake.

47
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,012
I lay there thinking, "Where is it?
Where did it go?"

48
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,182
-And I just-- I can't even-- I have no idea.
-Jesse, look.

49
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51, 935
Doesn't it make sense
that it wound up in the lab?

50
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,063
I thought about that a lot.
But I just don't see how.

51
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58, 692

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Well, look. You had the pack
in your pocket of your jacket, right?

52
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,319
-Yeah.
-And your jacket was in your locker.

53
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,738
So maybe the cigarette
fell out of the pocket...

54
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,284
...and wound up in the locker,
and now it's all burned up.

55
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,452
-It's gone.
-Yeah.

56
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,414
But I don't know that, you know?

57
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,708
I can't ever know for sure.

58
00206317,210 ==> 00206: 19,254
Well, look, did you check your house?

59
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,840
Did you--? Maybe it's
somewhere in your house.

60
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,383
No, man.

I've looked everywhere, okay?

61
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,344
-Your car? Did you check your car?
=NOx

62
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,097
-Thoroughly?
-Yes, of course. It's not in my house.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

63
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,766
It's not in my car.
The more I think about it...

64
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,019
...there's no way it fell out in my locker.

65
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,187
Somebody's gonna find it
on the street.

66
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,065
-You don't know that.
-Somewhere where I dropped it.

67
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,443
Some innocent person,
some kid maybe, even.

68
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,737
They're gonna pick it up,
and it's gonna--

69
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46, 364
-You're working yourself all up.
-Oh, my God!

70
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,825
You've gotta get ahold of yourself, here.

71
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52, 662
All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna come over there.

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55, 832
And together, we're gonna look
for this thing. All right?

73
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,042
Yeah.

There's no denying the popularity
of our product.

And obviously, Jesse and I

have manufacture covered.

137

00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,989

And, no doubt,
our profits will be smaller.

00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,580
...and outraged by the damage...

186
00:15:55,746 --> 00:16:00,460
...-his actions have wrought
upon my grandfather's company.

87

00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,338
Alleged actions.
88
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,592
An innocent man does not kill himself.
89
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,219

My people and I

00:

To your investigation,

 

90
6:10,386 --> 00:

 

are here to help.

 

6:15, 808

I pledge Madrigal's

full cooperation and transparency.

I confe

00:

But

So w

ss I have

believe

 

 

 

--> 00:16:19,979
my selfish reasons.

6:20,146 ==> 00:16223,191
Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

 

93
6:23,357 --> 00:16:27,236
if that is not the case,
I want to know it...
94
6:27,403 --> 00:16:29,489
...jJust as you do.
95
6:31,282 --> 00:16:33,409
hen you gonna announce it?
96
6:33,659 --> 00:16:35,411
I don't know.
97
6:35,578 --> 00:16:38, 664

As I'm walking out the door
with my big cardboard box.

198

00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,376
Can't do that. You know damn well
we're gonna throw you a big party.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

199
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,171
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

200
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,888
Outstanding police work, Hank.

201
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55, 681
If only I'd listened.

202
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59, 393
But I guess the damage was done.

203
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,065
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

 

 

204
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,654
Somebody's gotta go under the bus.

205
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11, 656
Ramey's a good man.

206
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,783
He'll do right by you.

207
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,662
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

 

 

 

208
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,790
Bullshit, it does.

209
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,209
Sir’.

210
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,966
What's with that A.P.D. thing?
The electromagnets?

211
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,093

They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

212
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,680
A couple of days before it happened,
desk sergeant gets a call...

213
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,015
...from a "postal inspector"
quote, unquote...

214
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,226
.-wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

215
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,354
And he told them? Jesus.

216
00217:43,521 =-> 00:17:45,314
Anything left of the laptop?

217
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47, 942
Do we look that lucky?

 

218
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,529
I sneaked a peek before A.P.D.
took it out of Fring's office.

219
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:56,158
The whole thing was encrypted. They

 

 

wouldn't have got anything anyway, but...

220
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01, 622
So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.

221],
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,710
But who gave Salamanca
the bomb?

222
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,463
Whole lot of questions
and not much in the way of answers.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

223
--> 00:18:10,923
Yet.

00:18:09, 630

224
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,094
The A.P.D. did find
some of Fring's financials.

225

00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,763

That just might lead to something.

22:6

00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,186

I had him out to my house.

227

00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,397

Fourth of July.

228

00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,649

We cooked out in the backyard.
229

00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,945

 

 

My son shucked the corn.
My daughter cut up potatoes.

230

00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,905

Fring brought sea bass.
231
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:40,161

Every time I grill
a little foil pouch,

it now, I make
just like he showed me.

232
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,913
That whole night, we were laughing...
233
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,333
...telling stories, drinking wine.
234
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,671
And he's somebody else completely.

Right in front of me.
236
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,638
Right under my nose.

237
00719:30,127 =-> 00:19:31,629
Hi. What can I get you?

238
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,091
-Just tea. Chamomile.
-Oh, sorry. We don't have chamomile tea.

239
00%19735,257 ==> 003198 87,760
Then some sort of bergamot,
not Earl Grey.

240
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,804
I like soy milk instead of dairy.

241
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,307
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

242
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,977
You're really running me
through my paces here.

243
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,438
Well, English breakfast, I guess.

244
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,065
We have Lipton's.

245
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,984
That's pretty much all we have.

246
00%19755,611 ==> 00319%59, 657
I would like a cup of hot water, filtered,
if possible, and a slice of lemon.

 

 

247
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,742
I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

248
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,204
Never mind. I brought my own.

249
002202 08,416 <> 003202 11,127
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

250
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,088
Face forward. We'll talk like this.

251
00220715,631 ==> 00:20:17,633
I guess I'm coming to you.

252
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,063
Take a breath, will you?

253
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,108
This place is safe.
No one's gonna see you here.

254
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,989
My God. Duane, this is so-- Thank you.

255
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,242
How did I not see you sitting back there?
So weird.

256
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,704
You want anything else, Mike?

257
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,791
No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks.

258
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,796
Now...

259
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,924
...how about
we lose the sunglasses?

I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

261

There you go.

262
00:21:09,226 --> 00721:11,979
Breathe in, breathe out.

263

Who killed Gus?

265
00%21:26,827 =-> 00:21:29,455
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

 

 

266
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,584
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

267
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,214
What's this?

268
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,840
A list of 11 names.

269
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,592
Okay.

270
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,803
You know them all.

271
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,223
I do.

272
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,683
Those 11 men--

And I think you know this, Mike.

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

273
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,228
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

274
00821752,3894 ==> 003213 56,232
-Where are we going with this?
-No specific.... I'm just pointing out facts.

275
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,484
These men--
Your men, yours and Gus’...

276
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,986
...they were on the payroll,
very publicly.

277
00#22:01,153 => 00:22: 03, 864
They trace back to Pollos, the laundry,
to Madrigal.

278
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,700
They're gonna get picked up
by the police. When they do...

279
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,370
...and threatened,
and there's only one way out--

280
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,206
And I'm not saying all of them, okay?

281
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,625
All it's gonna take is two or three,
or even one.

282
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,294
But there's always a weak link.
But they're gonna talk.

283
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,423
At least one's gonna talk about you,
me, and that's all it's gonna take.

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,468
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

285
00222:24,635 ==> 00:22:26,887
I never met your chemist, for instance.

286
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,765
I'd love your input.

287
00222433,310 #=>' 002223 36,397
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

288

That's a leap, what you just....

289
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,571
No, I didn't say that.

290
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:48,534
But if you think that'd be wise....

291
00222:52,037 --> 00:22:53,539
You're scared, aren't you?

292
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,457
Yeah.

293
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,336
You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

294

These are my guys,
and they are solid.

-They're sure to pick him up.
-They already have.

299

They picked him up last night.

300
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,108
My guys are solid.

301
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,360
I vetted them with great care...

302
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26, 363
...and Fring made sure
they were well compensated...

303
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,868
...in the event of a situation such as this.
They're paid to stand up to the heat...

304

no matter what.

305

And they will.

you've been watching...

00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,774
-Corporate security.
-Yeah.

351
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,528
What's that?
Like guarding the special sauce?

352
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,863
I conduct employee
background checks.

353
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,615
I oversee loss prevention.

354
00226:57,783 ==> 00327: 01,453
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

355
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,748
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

356
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,794
Yeah, well, if I were you,
I'd start sending out those résumés.

357
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,005

It says here
you're a private investigator?

358
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,134
-Where you licensed?
-New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

359
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,177
Every state where we operate.

360
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,389
Colorado?
You have some restaurants there, right?

361
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,184
-Colorado doesn't require licensure.
-Licensed to carry a firearm?

362
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,020
-Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
-Which states?

363
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,065
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

364
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,402
And if we pulled your CCPs,
everything would be in order?

365
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36, 446
I'm guessing you've already done that,
so you tell me.

366
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,827
You strike me as a former cop.

367
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,287
Am I right?

368
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,623
Where at?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
369
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,462
-Philadelphia.
-Philly.

370
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,427
The City of Brotherly Love.
Turns out we know some folks there...

371
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,722
...and they told us that your tenure
as a police officer...

372
002283 01,889 ==> 00728 05,726
...ended somewhat dramatically?

373
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,188
-You wanna talk about that?
-Not particularly.

374
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,607
Yeah, me neither.

375
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16, 862
See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring
decided to put a guy like you...

376
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,697
..in charge of his corporate security.

377
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,660
I mean, given your history...

378
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,539
..-doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

379
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,416
Seems like overkill.

380
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,835
What else you do for Fring?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
381
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,923
He must've needed help
running that drug empire of his, no?

382
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,136
Drug empire?
First I'm hearing about that.

383
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,180
I don't know anything about that.

384
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,516
We have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab...

385
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:51,271
..-and he'll testify to it. So from
here on out, this can go hard or easy.

386
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,273
So what's it gonna be?

387
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,078
Forget your handcuffs?

388
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,873
I'm confused.
Am I under arrest here, or am I not?

389
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18, 966
You wanna state that
for the camera?

390
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,307
You are not under arrest, currently.

391
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,851
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

392
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34, 982
Because you've got me very stirred up

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
with all these false accusations.

393
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,818
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

394
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,570
Oh, well....
395

00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,786
I suppose we could talk about
the $2 million...

396
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,206
...in your granddaughter's name.

397
00229:54,.376 => 00:29:58,171
Yeah. It seems Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts...

398
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,092
...that he would deposit money into.
Like, well, an even dozen of them.

399
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,804
And they're all in the names
of certain people on his payroll.

400
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,056
The manager of the laundry...

401
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,352
»..a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

402
00#30212,519 => 00:30: 16,189
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

403
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,818
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
404
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:25,741
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

405
00230227, 701 ——> 00302 31,330
Ten years old
and just cute as a button.

406
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,667
Yeah. Two million and change
we found on deposit for her.

407
00:30:35,834 =--> 00:30:37,419
Way more than anybody else.

408
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,006
Now, my partner here,
he took one look at that and said:

409
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:45,469
"Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the
muscle behind Fring's entire operation."

410
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,388
I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner,
slow down there.

411
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:53,393
Maybe it was actually
her dear old granddaddy."

412
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,149
Impressive, no?
That...level of insight?

413
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,319
He's not impressed, Gomey.

414
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05, 989
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

415

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:12,371
Yeah, well, I mean, the government's
gonna take every last dollar, unless....

416
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,375
Here's the thing, Mike-- Or Michael?

417

00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,627
-Mr. Ehrmantraut.
-Here's the thing, Mike.

418
00#31:18,794 => 00:31:20,462
Lucky, you didn't touch that money.

 

419

00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,632
cannot say the same

for the other 11 on the list.

420
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,842
One of your guys is gonna roll...

421

00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28, 387
...and then we'll definitely remember
the handcuffs.

 

422
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,350
Now, before that day comes,
you can do yourself a solid.

423
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,269
You can tell us what you know...

424
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38, 688
»..you can tell us
who's still out there...

425
00331:39,356 =-> 00:31:42,150
..-and if we like your story...

426
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,569
...good things can happen.

427

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,280
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

428
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,157
Maybe.

429
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,743
So what do you say?

430

00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,750
don't know anything
about any money.

 

431
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,754
I don't know what you're talking about.

432
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,229
First order of business is to find a new
place to cook. Before anyone says it...

433
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,856
-...no more RV's.
-I don't know.

434
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,818
-The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
-The "crystal ship"?

435
00%32:24,.985 --—> 00:32:27,195
Yeah. That's what I called it.

436
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,907
Well, I'll admit, it held its own
as a starter lab...

437
007322 31,074 =-> 00:32:33,452
...-but it was too dark, too small...

438
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,580
..not to mention it could've broken down
at any moment.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

439
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,041
Saul, find us someplace safe
from prying eyes.

440
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,419
Security against detection
is paramount.

441
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,715
But I don't wanna drive too far. No more
50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.

442
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,344
In town is trickier. I mean, you got
a lot more of your prying eyes.

443
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,265
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

444
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,313
Precursor. Where are we with that?

445
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:08,236
We're good on everything
except methylamine.

446
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,280
No surprise.

447
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,073
It's dry as hell out there.

448
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,618
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

449
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,578
Absolutely out of the question.

450
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,664
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I know it.

451
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,416
Yeah, but what if there's not?

452
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,627
Because there isn't.

453
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,086
I mean, really.

454
00%33425,253 ==> 003333 26,588
There is.

455
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,965
Have faith.

456
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,801
Can I offer a thought?

457
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,306
Say a guy wins the lottery.

458
002334 36,473 == 00733: 38,183
Ten million bucks.

459
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,186
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

460
003334417353 --> 00:33:43,897
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

461
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,859
He counts his lucky stars,
and he sails off into the sunset...

462
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,404
..which, seems to me,
and all due respect...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
463
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,449
...some advice you two might take.

464
00:33:55,075 =-> 00:33:56,910
What lottery did I win, exactly?

465
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,246
Hey, you're alive.

466
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,290
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

467
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,834
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

468
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,005
Counting the money that I owe Jesse,
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

469
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,300
Does that seem like an acceptable
stopping point to you?

470
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,180
There is gold in the streets...

471
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,392
...jJust waiting for someone
to come and scoop it up.

472
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,770
But me, I should quit now.
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

473
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,526
I got you this time, kid.

474
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,779

and I only get one?

476
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,702
That one's mine!

477
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,954
Green is beating orange.

478
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,623
-No.
-Green is beating orange.

479
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,251
Pink is beating your yellow one.

480
00934:53,925 => 00:34:55,885
I give up, baby.

481
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,347
You're too good.

482
002352 00,557 => 00:35: 01, 891
Yeah?

483
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,603
It's me. You got a minute?

484
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,689
Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow?

485
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,900
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

486
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,485
Say they want to talk more.

487
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,070
I'm sure they do.

Yeah, but, Mike,
the DEA take all my money.

490

I need it.

491
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,412
I need my money.

You understand.

What do you want me
to do about it?

494
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,335
I don't know.

495

I don't know. We gotta talk.

498
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,889
All right.

499
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,224
You give me two hours.

500

Chris.
501
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,818
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand...

502
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,155
...and then turn around very slowly.

503
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,839
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

504
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,655
How much was she gonna pay you?

505
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,494
Ten thousand a name.

506
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,915
How far did you get down the list?

507
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,083
Just Chow.

508
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,960
I figured I'd start with you.

509
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,297
For you, she was gonna pay 30.

 

 

510

I'm really sorry about this, Mike,
but I needed the money.

511

Those feds, they took it all, man.

B12

002392 00,171. <> 003.9: 03,216
Kiira, come and have some cookies.

516
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,928
-It's a cookie!
-It's a cookie, yes!

517
00239707,095 ==> 00339: 08,930
Let's go.

518
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,808
Let's count.

51.9
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,887
Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

520
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,723
-Hey, Mommy!
-What are you doing still up?

624.
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,433
Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss.

522
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56, 686
-She said she wanted to wait for you.
-She does, huh?

523
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,814
Well, who's the adult here, Delores?

524
00:39:59,981 =-> 00:40:03,526
-Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.
-Oh, yes, she ate everything.

525
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,278
She ate her peas, her carrots.

00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,531
Do whatever it takes to keep them
out of here, or they die.

527
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,241
-A whole lot.
-Understand?

528
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13, 328
-Yep.
-That's right, my girl.

529
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,957
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.
Put Kiira to bed and then go on home.

530
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,792
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Really?

531
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23, 963
-You don't want me to wait for you?
-No, you go home. Thank you.

532
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,507
Si, Miss Lydia.

533
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,429
Mommy, you gonna come
say good night to me?

534
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,140
Yeah, honey.
After Mommy takes a bath.

535
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,059
Okay.

536
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,436
Love you.

537
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,440

Mommy's very tired,

so let's go to bed.
538
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,080

Don't hurt my daughter.
539
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,377

I won't have to unless y

ou scream.

540
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,587
You know why I'm here?
541
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,300

What are you waiting for?

 

 

542
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,928
The nanny to leave.
543
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,557

If you have anything to say to me,
now's the time.

00:4

544
224,023 --> 00:4

226,943

Two good men died because of you.

00:4

545

229,737

Don't shoot

--> 00:4

231,656

me in the face.

 

 

546
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,492
Please. I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.
547
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,745

-Your daughter won't see you.
-She will. She'll find me.

548
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,582
-She never once sleeps through the night.
-Nobody's gonna find you.

549
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,377
Wait. What?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

550
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,630
No. No. No.

55.1
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,216
No. She has to find me.

552
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,969
-Lower your voice.
-She has to find me.

553
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,220
She has to find me.

554

00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:58,558
You want your 5-year-old daughter
stumbling across your dead body?

555
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,769
I can't disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

 

556
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,105
-She has to know that.
-Keep your voice down.

557
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,523
I don't care what you do.

558
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,775
I'll scream, and I'll keep screaming.

559
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,902
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

560
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,114
Shut up and calm down.

561
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:17,201
I don't care. You have to promise.
You have to promise me.

Promise I don't disappear.

563
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,824
Can you still get your hands
on methylamine?

564
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:05,041
Methylamine, Lydia.
Can you still get it?

565
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,086
Maybe.

566
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,172
Why?

567
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:39,325
~Yes?
-You still plan to move forward?

568
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,078
Yes, we do.

569
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,956
I've reconsidered.

570
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,749
I'm in.

571
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,378
Good.

572
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,608
Well, you missed a good meal.

573
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,238
The lasagna came out very well,
if I do say so myself.

574
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,161
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

BES!
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,054
You know, it gets easier.

576
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,183
I promise you that it does.

577
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,396

519
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,404
Everything.

580
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,242
It'll pass.

583

...then we've got
nothing to worry about.

584
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,650
And there's no better reason...

585
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,195
...than family.

-Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
-Hey, Dan.

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:17,309
-I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
-That'd be Dennis Markowski?

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,186
That's the one.

4
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,609
Oh, and I've got my paralegal
with me today.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,028
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.

6
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,738
You know it.

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,092
Hey, Dennis.

8
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,051
Have a seat.

9
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,162
You hear about Chow?

10
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,959
-Yeah, people say he skipped town.
-He's dead.

11
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,461
It wasn't me.

12
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,298
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

13

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,385
It was a mistake made by a third party
who has since been dealt with.

14
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,678
You got it?

15
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,346
-Yeah.
-Second thing.

6

00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39, 600

The deal you had with Fring,
it's still in place.

7
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,018
Okay.

8
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,811
Don't "okay" me.

 

9
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,896
You got something to say?

20
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49, 693
Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.

21
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,528
The laundry
was right above the lab.

 

 

22
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,739
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

23
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,158
I'm looking at eight years minimum.

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,161
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

25

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,288
I'm no rat, and you know it.

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,540
I mean, what else is there to say?

27
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,917
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

28
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,337
The deal is the deal.

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,092
How's the deal the deal?

30
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,470
The feds took away my hazard pay.

31
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,682
My wife asks me where the mortgage
is coming from. I got nothing to tell her.

32
00702:20,891 =-> 00:02:22,392
I knew the risks. We all did.

33
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,144
But that wasn't the deal.

34
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,230
And I know for a fact
they got Holt and Perez yesterday.

35
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,067
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay...

36
00202230,275 --> 00702: 33,528
-...sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
-No one's flipping.

37
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,198

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

38
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,535
I appreciate what you're saying and all,
but the man is dead.

39
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,954
Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.

40
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,249
-I just don't see it.
-I've got something new.

41
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,378
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

42
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,588
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

43
002:02:51,,797 =-> 00:02:53,799
-How?
-"How" is my business.

44
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,051
Hanging tight's your business.

45
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00, 430
Your family's gonna be fine.
You will be made whole.

46
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02, 683
Now, you got my word.

47
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,810
You need more?

48
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,816
No, Mike. I'm good.

49

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,780
-Who's next?
-That's your choice.

50
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,741
A.P.D.'s got Martinez across town.
McGann's up in Sandoval.

51
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,619
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

52
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,873
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

53
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,418
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,253
Yeah, I do.

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,506
Hey, let's go! Open up!

56
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,635
Back here.

57
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,783
Oh, hi. How was your day?

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,412
Are you moving back in?

ay)
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,957
Yeah. I'll keep the condo for now.

60
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,627
Selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

61

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,088
But, yeah, I'm home.

62
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,799
It's time.

63
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,554
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,682
Yes.

65
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,587
So you bring him here? Come on.

66
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,756
The three of us,
we're the three amigos.

67
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,217
All for one, one for all.

68
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,053
We don't need a fourth amigo.

69
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,932
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,560
-Mike's okay.
-He's okay?

71
00205151, 768 => 00:05:53,352
He said he was gonna
break my legs.

72
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,022
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

73

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00205:56,231 =-> 00:05: 58, 900
Because he gave me
the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.

74
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,444
Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

75
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,489
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

76
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,701
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,373
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,792
Duly noted.

79
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20, 630
All right. Let him in, Huell.

80
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,104
Mike, I'm extending you--

81
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40, 942
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules.

82
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,321
Division of labor.
I handle the business.

83
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46, 948
Making the stuff, that's your end.

84
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,368
I don't tell you how to mix
your chemicals and whatnot...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
85
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,623
...and you do not tell me
how to take care of business.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,667
Is that absolutely clear?

87
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,052
-Sure.
-All right. Let's take the tour.

88
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,474
Hey, you're okay with that?

89
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,518
Yes.

90
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,606
He handles the business,
and I handle him.

91
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,781
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

92
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,700
You need an ongoing business,
someplace you can slide in...

93
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,329
...do your thing and remain anonymous.
I'm not gonna mince words.

94
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,665
This is your best bet.

95
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,169
Got machines running, forklifts,
people coming and going.

96
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,880

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

97
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,634
And the owner's solid.

He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall...

98
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,804
...Stack some boxes in front of it,
give you the space you need.

99
00707:51,012 =-> 00:07:53,515
After that, he's got his business,
you've got yours...

100
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
..and never the twain shall meet.

LOA,
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,727
It's outstanding. Am I right?

102
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,772
Machines like this,
gotta be plenty of power.

103
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,190
What about the smell?

104
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,900
More good news.

105
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,195
I've been here when it's up and running.
This place stinks already.

106
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,447
-You'll blend right in.
-How many employees?

107
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,740
I knew you'd ask.

108

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,454
Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

09
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,373
You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.

0
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,750
Yes, indeed.

1
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,877
So, what do you say, maestro?

2
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,713
Is it unanimous?

 

 

3
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,008
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school...

114
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,678
...and I haven't seen
one of these in years.

15:
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,722
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

116
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,223
You know what this is?

alae)
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,225
It's a corrugator.

118
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,271
It uses steam and salt to crimp
kraft paper for cardboard.

119
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,858
And it makes a hell of a racket doing it,
which is great. Right?

120

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,526
No.

121
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,778
Steam and salt.

122
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,073
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

123
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,035
Shit. It'll ruin the product.

124
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:01,082
You can't just pop down to Costco
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

25
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,211
What--? Fine. Fine. Moving on.

26

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,345

Spacious, isolated location,
no humidity...

 

27

00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,973
...and you get all

the free tortillas you want.

28
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,559
That's the special feature of this place.

29
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,770
I don't know.

30
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,230
It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.

31
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,858
Somebody's bound to notice that.

 

32
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,278
All right. Well, there's gotta be

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
some kind of workaround, right?

133
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,989
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

134
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,366
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

135
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,496
Anything food-related is gonna have
unannounced government inspections.

136
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,174
All I'm asking
is that you keep an open mind.

137
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,719
Danny's already set some space aside
behind the Skee-Ball games.

138
002:09:55,637 => 00:09:58,598
-No.
-Hell, no.

139
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,067
I know it's a long shot.

140
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,278
All I can say to recommend this...

141
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:17,492
...is we're talking about an owner here who
is, how should I put it, highly amenable.

142
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,541
Look, I get it. Just say no
and we'll go get dinner.

143
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,960
All right. So I'll start.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
144
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,837
No way we're cooking in here.

145
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,840
No space, nowhere for the smell to go.

146
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,593
Look at that door. That thing rolls up
and we're open to the world.

147
002108 35,802 <-> 00:10: 371,384
I don't know if anybody noticed...

148
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10: 39,931
...but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

149
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,893
The hammer comes down,
it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.

150
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,400
-It's perfect.

-What?

51
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,777
How are we gonna fit a lab in here?

52
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,156
Who said here?

53
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,504
A house is infested.

54
OO#LL: ll, 713 => 00s112 14,i632
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.

 

55
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,094
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

218,303 --> 00:11:21,347

Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.
57
00: 221,556 --> 00: 223,474
The crew tents the house.
58
00% {23,682 ==> 00% 726,144
They bomb the place with poison.
59
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,188
The house stays like that for days.

00%

 

 

 

 

 

228,396 --> 00:11:30,607
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

161

00:11:30,815 =-> 00:11:33,193

Now, maybe there's a strange smell
coming out of it.
62
00: 233,401 --> 00: $35,236
Does someone think to investigate? No.
63
00211:35,653 --> 00:11:38,697
Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.
64
00: 241,700 --> 00:11:43,578
And that's where we'll cook.
65
00: 745,830 --> 00:11:49,375
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?
66
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,836
So we pick the one that's best for us.
67
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,047
Enough floor space, easy access.
68

 

 

 

 

 

00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,800

Once the tent is up,
go in, we cook a batch...
169
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,137
..we bomb the place and leave.

170
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,599
so we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

171
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,436
Set up a lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

172
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,773
It's challenging, but doable.

173
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,151
Tell me about these guys.

174
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,823
Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.
He's the owner. On the roof is Sandor.

175

O0#12221,0382 => 00s122 23,910
The ladder's Fernando,

and down below, that's Todd.

 

176
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,789
The pest control operation is legit.
I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.

177
00212:27,997 --—> 00212: 30,291
They do as good a job
as anyone in town.

178
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,211
But they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

179
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,422
-"Second-story"?
-B and E artists.

180

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,549
They're burglars.

181
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,551
Yeah. I mean, hey, they play it smart.

182
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,096
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

183
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,516
They copy the keys,
locate the valuables and alarms...

184
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,937
...and they sell that information to other
crews. Or, after a decent interval...

185
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,691
-...they'll lift the goods themselves.
-And you know them how?

186
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,071
Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out
of the fire, legally speaking, for five years.

187
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,741
Ira and his guys are good. I mean,
they know how to keep their mouths shut.

 

88
00%13203,950 ==> 00:13:06,119.
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

89
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,329
You can check into them yourself.

90
00213308,538 ==~ 00213: 11,958
I will, if it comes to that.

 

91
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,961
So do we take a vote?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
192
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,090
Why?

193
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,838
-We sound great.
-Rock on, man. Solid.

194
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,425
That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.

195
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,136
You like the sound? It's huge, huh?

196
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08, 348
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking
for something else today.

97
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,725
-You got any roadie cases?
-For sure. What size?

98
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,310
Biggest you got.

 

99
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,853
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

200
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,731
You got it. Follow me.

201
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
Top of the line.

202
00714:21,778 --> 00:14:25,323
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
quarter-inch laminated walls...

203
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,325
...3-inch casters.

204

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,662
Height is good, width is good.
How much weight will this hold?

205
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,623
It's rated for 900 pounds.

206
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,918
So unless your band plays lead bricks,
you should be okay.

207
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,089
We're gonna need....

208
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey, man, I'm trying to do business
over here, bitch.

209
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,512
Sorry. He's, like, overly enthusiastic.

210
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,932
Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.

211,
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,727
Four? That gonna be layaway? Because
I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.

212
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56, 604
No, man, cash.

213
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,481
Okay. Hey, you know what?

 

214
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,818
I'll throw in stenciling.
What's your band called?

 

215
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,330
Damn, brother.

216
00215:14,539 --> 00:15:17,917

Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

217
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,586
No joke.
You way back in business, man.

218
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,296
Look at this.

219
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,340
Yeah.

220
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,678
You're stacking the benjies
till the rubber band pops.

221
00#15:28,886 <-> 00:15: 30,096
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,890
All's we're saying is
we know you're major league now...

223
002154 33,099 ==> 00215: 35,476
-but if there's ever anything else
you need from us....

224
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,104
Any way we can get in on this at all.

225
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,606
Little stuff, big stuff....

226
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,900
e would be all over it.

=

227
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,864
You know, maybe someday.

228
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,287
That's cool.

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I guess we better hit it then.

229
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,414
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, brother.

230
00:15:56,622 =--> 00:15:57,915
Later.

231
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,421
Okay, it is the same job as always.

232
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,216
You go out, you inspect,
you deal with the customers, regular drill.

 

 

233
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:11,846
Everything's the same,
except for one important detail.

234
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,521
-No stealing.
-No stealing.

235
00816220, 730 <> 00s.16: 23, 816
Not a toothpick, not the spare change
between the couch cushions...

236
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,153
...-not the panties out of the hamper.
Nothing. And I mean nothing.

237
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,115
If you're out with your buddies and they
ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E...

238
00816: 31,324 => 00:16: 33,826
...you tell them you got nada.
You're out of the game.

239
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,955
The bottom line is that these houses
are out of bounds, now and forever.

All right.

242
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,129
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

243
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,757
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

244
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,884
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

245
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51, 427
You don't say "good morning."

246

00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,931
You don't speak

00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,143
On the other hand,
if they tell you to jump...

 

 

248
00216:59,352 +-> 00:17:02,605
...you don't ask what for,
you jump.

249
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,357
Now, you need a name for them?

250
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,236

You call them "Yes, sir" and "No, sir."

251.
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,033
You got any problems,
you come to me.

252
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,453
Here's the deal.
The finishing tank's a tight fit.

253
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,957

-And with this motor you've got on top....

-The agitation motor.

254
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,877
The agitation motor here on top,
the tank's not gonna fit in the box.

255
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,130
It's just.... It's just too tall.
256

00217:28,339 =-> 00:17:30,800
You know, I thought we'd put
a collar on the tank...

257
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,470
...and carry the motor in separately,
alongside the condenser.

258
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,391
And on the day,
we just kind of twist it into place...

259
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,726
-you know, while we're setting up.

260
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,980
~Yeah.
-Yeah.

 

 

261
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,315
-That's good.
-Yeah.

262
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47, 942
That will work.

263

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,403
And Joe and his guys can
build it, right?

264
O0s17:51,195 ==> 00017: 54,323
Yeah. You know, they're up for it.

265
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,034
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

266
008172 57,243 => 00s182 02,373
And, you know, I figure if they can
pull off the magnet, they can handle this.

 

267
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,251
Now, listen, about the smell....

268
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,629
About keeping it out of people's drapes
and furniture and whatnot....

269
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10, 631
When I was down in Mexico...

270
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,302
...there was this big, big,
plastic hospital tent...

2 Tal:
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,721
-they set up inside of the--

272
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,764
Oh, shit. Sorry.

273
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,435
Oh, hi. Sorry.

274
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,562
No, no, no. We were just wrapping up.

-Friend. Hi. Walt.

276
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,859
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

277
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,612
This is Brock.

278
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,572
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

279
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,574
I've heard a lot about you.

280
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,825
-Hi..
-Hi.

 

 

281
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,910
I understand you were in the hospital.

282
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,372
And Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

283
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,751
Yeah. A man of few words.

284
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49, 337
I'm sorry. He mostly just wants
to play his game.

285
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,921
Oh, I know that.

286
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,258
I have two of my own. A boy and a girl.

287
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,511
Well, I should go.

Are you sure you don't wanna...?

290
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,353
Yeah. Why don't you stay
for a beer at least?

291
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,398
Sure. Why not? A beer sounds good.

292
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,983
Thank you.

293
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,083
-How are you today, sir?
-We're good. Good. How are you?

-Family all packed up, ready to go?
-Yeah.

295
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,757
Here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets...

296
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,802
...and plants from the house
and that food has been removed...

 

297
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,179
...or double-sealed in the bags
we provided.

298
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,434
This acknowledges you've removed or
bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.

299

00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,103

you got any medicine you might need.

00220:29,.311. -—> 00:20:30,771
-It's already in the car.
-Okay.

301
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,108
Holy crap.
How much poison are you using?

302
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,986
It's not how much,
it's getting it where it's needed.

303
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,904
Those are your foggers.

304
002204 39,113 ==> 00220: 41,282
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure...

305
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,743
..-where it'll eliminate any nymphs
or larvae...

306
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,203
...as well as the full-grown blattodea.

307
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,248
So do we have all your keys?

308
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,500
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

309
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,294
-No, I'm good.
-Okay.

310
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,505

reenter the premises...

...until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

313
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,804
So you're gonna get them all, right?

314
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,016
We'll kill them dead.
That's a guarantee.

I just thought you should know.

-Yeah.

326

And the way she looks at you....

327
00225: 30,946 =-> 00:25:34,408
-You think?
-Oh, definitely.

328
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:44,376
So is it moving
in any particular direction?

329
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,172
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.
You know, sometimes I think...

330
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,840
.»..you know...

331
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52, 468
..if it feels right, then....

332
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,428
If it feels right, it feels right.

333
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,182

gotta listen to your gut.

What more can you ask, right?

336
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,815
Absolutely.

337
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
Cut the cards.

338
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,989
Have you thought about
what your plan is?

339
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,410
You know, vis-a-vis honesty?

340
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,664
You mean how much
she knows about this?

341
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,796
She doesn't know anything.

342
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,133
I mean, you know, she's not stupid.
She knows I'm into something, but....

343
002263 33,342 ==> 00226: 35,719
She could make
a pretty good guess.

344
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,679
But I never told her anything.

345
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,057
I'm not gonna.

346
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,017
Okay.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
347
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,479
I mean it.

348
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,148
I know you do.

349
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,486
Jesse, I can't pretend that this
doesn't affect me. It does.

350
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,324
But with everything that

we've been through, the two of us...

351
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,744
...this has to be your decision.

352
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,538
I mean, you've earned that.

353
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,290
Seriously?

354
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07, 668
Yeah.

355
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,842
Secrets create barriers
between people.

356
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,054
I'm speaking from experience,
believe me.

357
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,850
All that you've done...

358
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,727
.-it's a part of you, and....

359

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,359
I mean, if you choose to spend
the rest of your life with this person...

360
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38, 656
...then you'll have to decide
how much you'll share with her.

361
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:44,037
Meaning what? Like everything?

362
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,375
Like Gale?

363
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,218
I'm just trying to say that I trust you...

364
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02, 680
...and I know you'll make the right call.

365
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,483
If she loves you...

366
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,944
...she'll understand.

367
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,782
They're leaving streaks.

368
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24, 661
This more ethnic-looking one,
he's doing a great job...

369
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,790
...but the other one is going back and forth
like he's scrubbing a wall.

370
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,586
They have to go in circles...

371
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34, 630
...or you're going to leave streaks.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
372
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,257
That's pretty basic, right?

313
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,928
I don't mean to tell you your business.

374
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:45,390
It's just-- It's simple quality control.

375
00#28:48,185 <-> 00:28:52,397
So I've got some good news.

376
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,857
Guess what.

377
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,776
What?

378
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,987
No, really. I want you to guess.

379
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,242
-Marie, I really--
-Okay. Hank's back at work.

380
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,953
-That's wonderful.
-Yeah.

381
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,206
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

382
00229: 09,414 => 00:29: 12,292
Merkert and all the rest,
they laughed him out of the office...

383
002293 12,501, => 00229: 15,837
...when he told them
about that chicken man.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

384
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,966
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

385
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,343
If it were me, I'd tell them all
to go to hell.

386
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,845
Do I sound bitter?

387
00229724,054 ==> 00329: 25,931
But it's what he wants, right?

388
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,808
Yeah, it's doing him good.

389
00%29:28,016 =-> 00:29: 31,603
I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.

390
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,522
He's hardly using his cane at all.

391.
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,483
And thank you for that, really.

392
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:41,738
I mean, God knows where he'd be
if we had to go through his health plan.

393
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,032
I'm just glad he's feeling better.

394
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,786
So, speaking of which,
we have another big event coming up.

395
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,122
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

Walt's birthday.

397

Whatever you need, I'm here.

398
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,088
Yeahs Ts ws«

399
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,465
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

400
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,509
What are you talking about?

401
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,511
Of course we're gonna do something.

402
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,223
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

403
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,766
Dave es

404
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,810
So it's been a whole year.

405
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,895
Listen, I've had my problems
with Walt.

406
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,065
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically--

407
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,817
Whatever. Water under the bridge.

408
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,486
But at this point, every year is precious.

You can't be serious!

With the baby and Walt?

413

00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:36,084

You're not smoking around the baby,

are you? And you can't smoke here.

 

414

There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

You can't force your employees

What? I'm sorry...

-It means I don't know what else to call it.

But I've never seen her like that, ever.

Did you know she's smoking?

459
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:10,549
A couple weeks back,
Ted took a fall, a bad one.

460
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,842
He gave himself a concussion...

461

462
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,514
He's still in the hospital.

He may never walk again.

Oh, my God. I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

is worth 20 percent?

526

00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,372

No. Jesse, thank you...
577

«+<.but. no.
578

00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,376
I'll pay my share.

579
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,962
Go ahead.

580
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,887
Let me tell you something.

582
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:27,105
..-is how it's gonna be
from here on out.

583
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,776
My guys are an ongoing expenditure...

584
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,279
...SO you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

585
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,542
A hundred and thirty-seven thousand.

586
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,922
That's less than with Fring.

587
00243454,215 == 00243: 58,553
Listen, Walter.
Just because you shot Jesse James...

588
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,140
...don't make you Jesse James.

589
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,149
Tomorrow.

590
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,791
How are you feeling?

591
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,710
Okay, I guess.

592
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,547
Broke it off with Andrea.

00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,924
I had to.

She's gonna tell Brock.

595
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,056
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

596
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,977
-It's the right thing to do, but, you know--
-I meant this.

597
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,396
How are you feeling
about the money?

598
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,567
You're looking at it wrong.
When we worked for Gus...

599
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,069
..we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

600
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:01, 698
This last batch was great,
but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.

601
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05, 328
We maybe cleared less money,
but we got a bigger piece of the pie.

602
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:10,666
It's like you said, we're owners,
not employees.

603
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,422
I've been thinking about Victor.

604
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,758
Yeah?

605
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,968
Yeah.

00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,475
...I was sure that
Gus did what he did...

608
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,560
...to send me a message.

609
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,106
Maybe there's another reason.

Like what?

611
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41, 948
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

612
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44, 408
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

613
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49, 622

1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:05,672
Gotta say, when you first brought
her in, I had my doubts.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,967
But your little darling's got nine lives.

3
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,557
Rear-wheel assembly took the brunt
of the impact. So....

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,309
Yeah.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,062
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle....

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,606
Replaced all of it. No way around it.

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,442
I went aftermarket
on most of the parts here.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,945
You want me to swap in factory parts,
that's fine.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,323
But using aftermarket's the only way
we'll keep it under Blue Book...

10
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,117
...and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

de
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,161
Nothing beats free.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,041
Swapped out your air filter,
topped off your fluids.
13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,418
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

14
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,379
I know, right?

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,424
Oh, and I noticed you had
some sort of gunky buildup...

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,134
...in the front end here.

17
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,971
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,973
Then I remembered
you had me replace...

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,561
...that front fender a few months back
when you ran over that deer.

20
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,189
We went at it with the steam hose,
cleaned it up for you.

21
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,900
Hardest part was the paint.

22
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,529
Fern green. Interesting tint.

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,905
Anything else?

24
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,284
That's it. Zero balance, like I said.

Hey, Benny.

31

00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,743
What would you give me for it?

32

00201 :57,951, ==> 00202: 00,037
-What's the Blue Book, you mean?

-No.

33

00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,540
I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

34

00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,294
-Well, I'm not really looking for....
-A hundred dollars?

35

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,088

Fifty?

36

00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,050
Insurance company just shelled out
1900 for the parts alone.
37
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,926
Then it's a bargain.

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,513
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

39
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,307
You sure about this?

40
00202220, 515 =<“ 00: 022 21,725
Sure as shooting.

41
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,311
I'll check the register.

42
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,480
Dad?

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,316
Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?

44
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,641
-Gotta be kidding me.
-Lydia?

45
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,543
Ok, Chxrdist..

46
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,216
I'm at work right now.

47
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,801
Yeah, I know.

48
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,761
This is a heads-up. You got visitors.

49
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,807
Visitors? What...? You mean today?
50
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,935
I mean 30 seconds.

51
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,107
Come in.

52
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,153
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

53
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,741
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

54
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,036
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

55
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,788
Yes, we did.

56
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,123
What can I do for you?

57
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,202
There. The foreman.

58
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,664
Navy pants, powder-blue shirt.

59
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,802
Hey, buddy.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,084
-Yeah?
-They got Ron.

61
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,669
Ron's done.

62
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,296
Okay.
63
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,422
No. No.

64
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,592
Not okay, Mike.

65
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,844
Not okay. The....

66
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:13,141
The look he just gave me was
the very antithesis of "okay," okay?

67
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,601
Breathe, Lydia.

68
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,311
No one's talking to the police.

69
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,689
I just had like 14 DEA agents...

70

00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,525
..-barge into my office,

screaming and yelling at me...

 

71
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,737
...and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

72
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,489
The warehouse.

713
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,242
Besides, Ron was my guy. Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

74
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,037
Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels,
drove the truck.

75
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,625
You can't expect me to do that stuff.
I mean, let's be realistic.

76
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,340
Mike, this is crazy.

77
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,176
I'll send a new guy.

78
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,995
You're crazy.

79
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,080
My car almost has 500 horsepower.

80
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,250
-It would totally smoke--
-Horsepower isn't everything.

81
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,543
Don't you know that?

82
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,880
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension...

83
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,841
...and weight of the car.

84
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,343
One more factor
that you're not thinking about:

85
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,054
The experience of the driver.
I totally got you there.

86
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,932
-Please. Please. You drive like a geezer.
-I got you.

87
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,809
Really? I drive like a gee--

88
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,979
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

89
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,773
-Bullshit you ever did donuts.
-Watch your language.

90
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,525
-And, yes, I did.
-Seriously?

91
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,444

Yes, seriously. And if you show me...

92
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,988
-+-just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

93
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,824
-Yeah? Yes?
-No. No, I won't. I take that back.

94
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,161
-Yes. Yes. No. You're saying yes.
-Just a joke. I'm just....

95
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,746
No! No, no. That was kidding.

96
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,956
-We didn't shake on it. No.
“Yes. Yes.

97
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,750
-We are now.
-That doesn't count!

98
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,295
I know you don't approve.
99
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,591
But mine...

100
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,011
...we'll call a birthday present
to myself.

101
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,472
And Junior's....

102
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:21,603
People will just chalk that up
as me being a softy.

103
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,440
And besides...

104
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,359
-I didn't actually buy either one.

105
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,072
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

06
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,115
Okay?

07
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,380
We can afford it now.

08
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,469
You're back at it?

 

09
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,138
Well, yeah.
10

00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,101
We have to make up
that 600,000 we lost.

What do you think
about boarding school?

00:10:15, 365

112
--> 00:10:17,200

Boarding school?

00:10:17,408
For who?

00:10:20,870

113
--> 00:10:19,828
For Junior?

28
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,381
What's wrong with their environment?
29
00: 216,759 --> 00: 218,011
Nothing.
30
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,228
Hey.
31
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,568
Listen, I know these last few weeks
have been rough.
132
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:38,489
The threat to Hank

and this whole thing with Beneke.

00:

00:

133
--> 00:
But there's absolutely

11:39,574

134
11:42,452

1:42,243
nothing...

 

--> 00:

1:45,079

...for you to be afraid of anymore,

00:

I mean,

okay?

135
--> 00:11:48,291

11:45, 288

clear sailing from here on out.

I promise.
00:11
You know,

136
251,127 --> 00:11:56,841
I want us to try and start

looking forward to things again.

00:11

137
357,342 --> 00:12:00,637

Speaking of which, my birthday.

138

00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,974

I don't know--

I don't know what you have planned...

139

00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,519

that's

00312:

-and with everything
been going on lately...

140
08,727 --> 00:12:11,439

...I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

00:12:

00212:

41
1,648 --> 00:12:14,859
But I think...

42
5,068 --> 00:12:17,654

-a little celebration might be good.

00:12:

43
7,862 --> 00:12:19,781
For all of us.

44

 

00212:

9,989 --> 00:12:23,618

You know, a birthday party.

45

00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,537

 

0081222
00212 :3
0021223

What do you think?

46
9,624 --> 00:12:31,334
Yeah?

47
1,542 --> 00:12:33,211
Okay.

 

48
3,419 =-> 00:12:36,172
And maybe, if I may be so bold...

149
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,343
.chocolate cake with chocolate icing?

150
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,308
Life is good, Skyler.

151
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,245
-Thank you.
-Hey, Mom, you forgot something.

52
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,622
Dad's bacon.

53
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,999
That's okay. I can do it.

54
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,710
No. Mom has to.

55
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,299
Well, it is sort of a tradition.

56
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,680
Watch this, Holly.

57
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,141
Watch what she does with bacon.

58
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,727
Watch. Watch this.

 

59
00213: 31,102 => 00:13:35,565
What is she doing?

What is she doing?

 

 

60
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,447
That's a pretty small "1."

 

61
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,574
Kind of is.

162

00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,825

Just a little

163

00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,748
Now you're talking.

164

00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,208

-No. No.
-Good move.

165

00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55, 668

=NOx
-No, no, no. It's

66
00213: 55,877 ==> 00:

good.

3:57,420

Very good. Family teamwork.

67
00:13:57,795 --> 00:
Making sacrifices. Very

68
00:14:00,423 --> 00:
-Happy birthday,
-Thank you, bud

69
00:14:03,301 --> 00:

You want some?

70
00:14:04,677 --> 00:

4:00,214
important.

4:03,092
Dad.
dy.

4:04,469
5

4:06,387

Guy's some piece of work, isn't he?

 

71
00:14:07,846 --> 00:

Six feet under and ha
he's still screwing

172
00:14:10,558 --> 00:
So, what's nex

173

4:10,224
f a face,
with us.

4:12,393
CP

 

00:14:12,602 --> 00:

4:14,520

I don't know. I don't know.
174
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,023
This Madrigal thing seems hinky,
though, you know?

175
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,400
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
in Germany...

176
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,780
...and 5000 miles away,
you got this guy.

177
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,325
There's gotta be someone in the middle,
you know? Someone we're missing.

178
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,498
What about that
Lydia what's-her-name?

79
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,249
Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?

80
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,627
In this world? No way.

81
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,212
Too uptight. Too together.

82
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,505
Maybe.
83

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,841
She was wearing mismatched shoes.

84
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,094
How together can she be?

 

85
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,767
Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?

 

 

 

86
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,270
You know, just working through
the grief.

187
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,107
How soon before you submit a final?

188
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,318
Well, we've been kicking around
some ideas.

189
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,320
Had you asked a couple of weeks ago...

190
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,697
...I'd have said
this was a mop-up job, but....

191
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,951
-But?
-None of Fring's crew is talking to us.

192
00%15:10,159 ==> 00:15:12,453
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

193
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,164
Makes it likely there's somebody
keeping them in line.

194
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,501
Our money is on this guy,
Michael Ehrmantraut.

195
00%15:18,709 => 00:15:21,629
He's Fring's head
of "corporate security."

196
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,715
-He's a definite hard case.
-Now, we're gonna stay on him.

197
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,760
We're putting together
a surveillance team as we speak. Okay?

198
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,554
The other thing is....

199
00215429, 762 ==> 00215: 31,431
This may be unrelated...

200
O0e15231,639 --> 00:15:34,851
...-but the blue meth is making

a bit of a comeback. Tell him, Gomey.

201

002152 35,059 --> 0015: 37,353
Yeah. Some small amounts
on the street-side pulls.

 

202
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,439
Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.

203
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,816
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out...

204
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,278
..or it could be somebody's rebooting...

205
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,240
...using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

206
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,908
I thought we had Fring's cooks.

207
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,119
The unsubs in the lab fire.

208
00215253,327 --> 00:15:55,413
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

209
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

210
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,961
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

211
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,507
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

212
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,551
Yeah.

213
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,559
Hank, I gotta say,
your work here has been stellar.

214
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,603
Really first-rate.

215
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,229
Thank you, sir.

 

216
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,691
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

217
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,903

You know I have to get back to El Paso.

218
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,405
This office needs an ASAC...

219
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,116
-and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

220
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,327

If you were to put in an application...

221
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,872
...and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

222
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,876
I have no doubt this D.O. would be
well served with you at the helm.

223
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,546
THAE "Ss 3 ae

224
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,466
I'm not sure what to say.

225
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,844
It's a big step up.
It's not without its headaches.

22:6
00216:52,053 =-> 00:16:54,013
The politics may take
some getting used to.

227
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,432
You'd be overseeing every case
in the office...

228
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,894
...So you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days, Fring included.

229
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,730
Much as I hate losing
a good field man...

230
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,399
...that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

231
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,653
What do you say, Hank?

232
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,822

You want it?

233
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:18,579
Well, considering my wife
would murder me if I said "no"....

234
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,500
Yeah. I want it.

235
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,627
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
236
00217:34,095 => 00:17: 38,266
Can you finish up for me?
237
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,560
It's.... It's my birthday.
238
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,437
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
239
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,526

 

 

I probably have a birthday party
waiting for me, you know, so....

240
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,487
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, no problem.

241
00%17:52,697 ==> 00:17:54,657
Hey, happy birthday.

242
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,326
Thanks. Thanks.

243
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,685
-Hey, Dad.

-Hey.

 

 

244
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,069
Where's your mom?

245
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,904
00:

00:

00:

Kitchen.

246
8:40,494 --> 00:
Hey.

247
8:41,871 --> 00:
Oh, hey.

248
8:46,542 --> 00:
So, what's the p

249
8:51,839 --> 00:

8:43,789

8:50,671

8:53,549
their way.

8:58,179

Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner,
rocky road for dessert...

00:

-and

OO:

8:58,387 --> 00:

9:16,906 --> 00:
What's up?

253
9319,492 --> 00%
Me?

254
9221,.243 ==> 00:
Nothing.

9:21,035

9:22,870

Thought you'd be more jazzed

about the new j

256

ob.

00319328,292 =-> 00:19:29,877

No. What...? No.

257

I am.

00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,171
-Baby, I'm so proud
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

258

of you.
00219432,380 --> 00219: 35,299
-Sorry, sorry.
-I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

259
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,098
Marie, you've been moping around
the last few days.

260
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,309
Marie?

261
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,021
What's up?

262
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,983
-Marie, come on.
-I'm sorry. I--

263
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,736
I made a promise to someone.

264
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,698
To who?

265
002203 01,450 ==> 002203 038,953
-Who?
-Your brother-in-law.

266
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:11,502
-Are you gonna give me a hint at least?
-It involves infidelity. That's all I'll say.

267
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,675
Oh, shit. I knew it.

268
00:20:19,927 =--> 00:20:22,012
Knew what? What did you...?
What did you know?

269
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,683
Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've
been, you know, saying it forever.
270
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,185
Walt's second cell phone, you know?

271
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,147
Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you
on this one.

272
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,941
Way ahead of me.

273
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,113
Well, it wasn't Walt.

274
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,535
Skyler?

219.
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,915
No way.

276
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,464
Hey.

277
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,216
-Hey! There she is.
-Hey! Hi!

278
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,593
-Hey!
-Hey, buddy.

279
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,388
Hey, pal.
Welcome. Welcome. Come on in.

280
00221:04,597 ==> 00:213 07,057
Happy birthday. Hi.

281
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,351
I'm in the center lane going about 60.

282
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,188
I had no choice but to just tear butt
out of there.

283
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,523
Just: So sweet.

284
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,692
Highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

285
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,736
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

286
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,031
You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank,
now that you run the DEA?

287
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,826
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled-brat,
car-wash-millionaire nephew?

288
00%21:26,035 => 00:21:29,371
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

289
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,123
All right.

290
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,083
Well, I'm out of here.

291
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,335
Okay.

292
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,420
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, buddy.

 

 

293
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,631
Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.

294
002215 38,839 ==> 002213 39,882
Thanks.

295
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,301
-I'll see y'all later.
-All right.

296
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,928
-Bye. Be safe.
-Have fun.

297
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,638
-Drive safely, okay?
=I dos

298
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,557
-Slow down.
-Never.

299
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,943
A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.

300
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,738
Honey, for my next birthday,
I'm gonna take a page here from Walt...

301
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,323
...and buy myself a jet plane.

302
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,743
Maybe I overdid it a little.

303
002%22:07,952 --> 00322:09,537
But with these new lease rates....

304
00222709, 745 => 00:22:13,833
I mean, they're mighty attractive. Yeah.

305
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,843
Great dinner, Skyler.

306
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,846
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.

307
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,347
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

308
00222:29,557 --> 00:22:30,724
How do you do that?

309
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,727
A potato ricer.

310
--> 00:22:37,314
don't hand-mash?

00522: 33,936
A ricer? You

311
--> 00:22:40,067
No.

00:22:38,566

312
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,787
-Wel
-Boy, it

has....

313
00:22:51,996 =-> 00:22:54,957
It has been quite a year, huh?

314
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,293
Do you know that...

315

00:22:57,501 =-> 00:23:00,296

-it's almost exa

ctly a year ago...

00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,131

 

...that I got my diagnosis?
317
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,924
-Jesus. Yeah, right?
-Yeah.
318

00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,428

-It seems like lo

-Yeah. No.

nger, doesn't it?
EGS seas
319
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,890
One year ago tomorrow.

320
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,684
The day after my 50th.

321
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,480
Honestly never thought
I'd make it this far.

322
00223219,148 ==> 00:23:22,192
With the cancer and surgery...

323
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,029
...and Hank being shot....

00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,366
So many dark days.

326
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,409
Well ..ss

327
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,913
There's Marie's talking pillow.

328
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,873
Remember that?

329.
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,168
It was effective.

330
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,546
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

33.1
00223:45,215 <-> 00:23:48,385
I think I was too scared...
332
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,888
«..Or too angry or....

333
O0923251,096 => 00123:54,016
I don't know. I just wanted to quit.

334
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,688
But you guys....
You got me through it somehow.

335
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,941
Kept me going.

336
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,029
And that happened again
and again and again.

337
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,573
I mean, there were times...

338
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,785
..when I was sure I was done for.

339
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,915
But then someone or something...

340
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,668
...would come through for me.

341
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,755
God. And Skyler, I can't--

342
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,133
Honey, remember
that first week of chemotherapy?

343
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,636
That night on the bathroom floor?

344
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,721
What you said to me?

345
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,976
I was so sick.

346
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,062
It was rough going at first.

347
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,606
But Skyler....

348
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,025

She was right there, of course...

349
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,903
..-putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

350
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,072
And she's singing to me.

351
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,033
And this would go on and on...

852
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,744
.day after day.

353.
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,581
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom...

354
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,086
...-because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

355
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,922
And my head
was in Skyler's lap...

356
00225): OF,c 31 -=> 0032.5: 10,175
...and I was just asking her...
357
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,470
...if this could all be over.

358
00225:14,972 => 00:25:16,932
It was too hard. It was....

359
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,642
I just wanted it stopped.

360
00:25:18,851 =-> 00:25:21,854
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

 

361
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,734
Hey-o. Pool party.

362
00225:27,.943 ==> 00:25:29,527
What are you doing, Skyler?

363
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,364
What is she doing? Walt?

364
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,159
Hey, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

365
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,534
What do you think?

366
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,912
Skyler, Hank asked you a question.

367
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,207
You need to get out.... Skyler!
368

00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,960
She's gonna come up, right?

369
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,004
She has to.

Okay. It's gotta be....

374
26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,997
Nope.

375
26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,459
Okay.

376
26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,545
Come on!
How am I supposed to--?

377
26:41,517 =--> 00:26:43,227
Hey.

378
26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,020
Wait.

379
:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,815
Wait, wait. Who are you?

380
:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,567
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the...?

381
:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,528
Hold on. Hold on.

382
:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,655
Who sent you?

383
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,407
Who sent me? Who do you think?

384
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,452
No. I'm asking you.

385
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,704
Mike.

386
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,583
And this Mike person....

387
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,293
What's his last name?

388
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,547
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico...

389
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:16,009
..-and I got a 900-mile drive back.
That's 14 hours if I don't stop.

390
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,805
So the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

391
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,812
Ehrmantraut.

392
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,773
Okay? Satisfied?

393
00:27:33,152 =-> 00:27:35,653
Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologize
for being careful.

394
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,115
With all that's been happening,
for all I knew...

395
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,284
...you were one
of those undercover people.

396
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,327
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day...

397
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,330
...over getting gang-raped
by prison guards.

398
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,083
No doubt. So where's the--?

399
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,878
Up there. Number 22356.

400
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,048
That's the one I erased from
the inventory, so it has to be that one.

401
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,925
Can you reach it?

402
00227757,134 ==> 00:27:59,720
Yeah, with, like, a forklift.

403
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,971
You got one?

404
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,660
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

405
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,958
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What?

406
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,503
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

407
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,899
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

408
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,902
No. No, of course not.

409
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,949
Noy Ow I JUsStssss

410
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:13,085
She and I have been
having some issues.

411
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,590
Yeah, yeah.
I might've heard a little bit about that.

412
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,010
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

413
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,889
She just, you know, said that,
you know, you guys were...

414
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,268
..- having some issues.

415
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,731
So, what's the next move?

 

416
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,443
Might be good to have her talk
to someone.

417
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,114
-I agree.
-Yeah.

418
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,200
-I'm gonna get on that first thing.
-Yeah.

419
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,661
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

420
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,372
She seems really happy with him.

421
008294 51,3738 == 008298 55,335
Not that Marie's an advertisement
for advanced mental health or anything.

422
00229:56,837 =-> 00:29:58,380
You know....

423
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,384
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

424
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,224
Some birthday, huh?

425
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,486
She's gonna try and get some sleep.

426
00830¢21,695 ==> 003308 23,196
Okay.

427
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,829
What was that?

428
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,706
I don't know.

429
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,918
-I mean, was she trying...?

-No, not in a swimming pool. No.

430
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,464
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

431
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,217
But we both...
432
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:49,097
...think that
she should talk to someone.

433
00230751,308 ==> 003303 52,851
I'm gonna get you Dave's number.

434
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,603
Okay.

435
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,650
Listen, Walt, I....

436
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:05,030
I can't help but sense
that there may be some issues...

437
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,491
-between you and Skyler.

438
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,701
None of our business, of course.

439
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,496

And, Hank, I don't know if you've...

440
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,458

-...picked up on any of the--
-He knows. He knows know.

 

441
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,969

These things happen in a marriage...

442
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,888
-but it isn't unfixable.

443
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,644

I think what would be great is if...

444
00:31:35,852 =-> 00:31:38,563
...you two had some space...

445
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,775
...to work through this stuff.

446
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,568
SOuses

447
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,030
And keep an open mind here.

448
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,159
What if we took the kids for a while?

449

00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,579

-Took the kids?
-Absolutely.

 

 

450
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:58,625
We'll look after them for a day or two,
or however long...

451
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,711
...and leave you and Skyler...

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,131
»..to look after each other.

453
00#32:04,339 <-> 00:32: 06,'633
That's very generous of you, Marie...

454
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,971
-but I.... I just don't see
how that's a solution.

455
O0832<¢11,179 ==> 003323 12,681
And, I mean--

456
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:17,352
Besides, Junior and Holly,
that's a lot of work.
457
00232217,561 --> 00732:19,020
No, it isn't.

458
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,397
Junior's independent...

459
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,067

..and my niece is only the easiest...

460
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,195
..-most delicious baby
that was ever born.

461
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,907
-It'll be fun, right?
-Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah.

462
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,035
Absolutely. Yeah. It's a good idea.

463
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,788
Well, I think it's a great idea.

464
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,042
Just the thing for both of you.

465
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,094
Marie, this idea....

466
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,222
Was it yours?

4607
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,892
Actually, it was Skyler's.

468
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,400
She really needs this, Walt.

469
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,279
Yep.
470
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,665
I gave Marie bottles.

471
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,960
They'll stop and pick up diapers
along the way.

472
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,005
I spoke with Junior on the phone...

473
00233:27,214 =-> 00:33:29,299
...and after much discussion...

474
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:34,054
..-he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes. And so voila...

475
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,515
...the kids are out of this environment.

476
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,600
What a coincidence.

477
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,312
I know you're awake.

478
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,276
What was that about?

479
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,445
Can you explain it?

480
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,700
I don't want the children here anymore.

481
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,827
It isn't safe.

482
00233:58,036 =-> 00:34:02,999
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.
483
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,626
It has never been more safe.

484
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,836
"Never been"?

485
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,714
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house...

486
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,008
...to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

487
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,928
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

488
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,888
And I dealt with him. It's over.

489
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,765
It is not.

490
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,017
You're right back
in the meth business again.

491
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,354
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

492
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,274
So wait. Now that you're in charge...

493
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,527
..it's what? It's gonna be
smooth sailing from here on out?

494
00234: 30,735 <-> 003.342 32,112
I don't see why not.
495
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,157
I keep the work at work, Skyler...

496
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,077
...and nothing will ever
impact you or the kids.

497
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,122
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

498
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,916
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

499
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,377
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

500
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,005
I thought you were the danger.

501
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,015
Is that what your pool stunt was about?

502
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,392
Trying to protect my children from me?

503
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,311
Not just you.

504
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,688
There's blood on my hands too.

505
00235706,896 ==> 00:35:09,733
What blood? Beneke?

506
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,277
He's in the hospital because of me.

507
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,070
=NOx
-Because of what I did.

508
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,740
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up
over this thing.

509
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,659
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

510
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,203
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control...

511
00%352.22,412 => 00235: 25,373
...-but you did what you had to
to protect your family. I'm sorry.

512
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,376
That doesn't make you a bad person,
it makes you a human being.

cps}
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:32,255
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.

514
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,175
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

515
002354 35,383 ==> 00735: 36,801
I'm in it now.

516
00:35:37,010 =-> 00:35:39,137
I'm compromised. But I won't--

 

517
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,307
I will not have my children
living in a house...

518
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,186
..where dealing drugs
and hurting people and killing people...

519
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,314
...is shrugged off as "shit happens."

520
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
We're back at it? Fine.

521
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,361
But the kids stay away, and that's that.

522
00%35754,569 ==> 003353 56,237
"That's that"? That's what?

523
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,239
I got them out of this house.

524
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,950
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

525)
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,535
They spend a day or two...

526
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,622
...dunior stays up late watching movies,
and then what happens?

527
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,500
-We'll see.
-No, I'll tell you what happens.

528
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,087
They come home to this house,
to their parents who love them.

529
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,881
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

530
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,675
How many times do I have to say...
531
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,677
-...that they are not in--?
-I said no.

532
00236:18,885 ==> 00:36:22,013
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

533
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,356
What are you gonna do to stop it?

534
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,903
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

535
00:36:37,112 =-> 00:36:39,155
Like what? I mean, specifically.

536
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,032
What is your next move?

537
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,410
My next move is maybe I hurt myself.

538
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,578
Make it clear we need more time.

53.9
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,997
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

540
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:52,168
No, more like you're still struggling. So
maybe next time, I have you committed.

541
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,172
Put you in some inpatient facility
while I take care of the kids myself.

542
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,550
Is that what you want?
543
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,053
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck...

544
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,847
..-give myself a black eye...

545
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,724
...Ssay that you beat me...

546
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,560
...when you found out about my lover.

547
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,188
I see.

548
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,275
So you want to involve Ted?

549
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,735
Oh, well, that'll be fun...

550
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,404
...bringing the police

up to speed on all of that.

 

551
00237:19,612 ==> 00:37:22,657
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son...

 

552
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,410
...that his father is a wife-beater.

553:
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,037
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

554
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,542
-I could send Junior away to school.
-Now here's the conversation:
555)
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,837
"So, honey, I know you've only got
one year left in high school...

556
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,423
...but I would love it
if you'd drop everything...

557
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,968
...leave all your friends behind,
and go to boarding school in Arizona."

558
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,554
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing...

559
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,306
...a solution to your problem.

560
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,686
How are you going to save our kids
from this terrible environment?

561
00837751,895 s=> 00337: 53,521.
=E don," ts ws «
-What are you gonna do?

562
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,816
Run off to France? You gonna
close the curtains, change the locks?

563
00237:57,025 --> 00:37:58,818
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.

564
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,363
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

565
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,367
-What's the plan?
-I don't know!

566
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,496
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

567
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,458
I will count every minute
that the kids are away from here...

568
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,794
...away from you, as a victory.

569
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,463
But you're right.

570
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,132
It's a bad plan.

 

571
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,262
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.

572
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,889
I don't know what to do.

573
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,183
I'm a coward.

574
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,229
I-- I can't go to the police.
I can't stop laundering your money.

575
00238: 34,437 =-> 00:38: 36,356
I can't keep you out of this house.

576
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,317
I can't even keep you out of my bed.

577
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,530
All I can do is wait.

578
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,698
That's it. That's the only good option.
579
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,452
Hold on, bide my time...

580
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,246
...and wait.

581
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,209
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

582
002382 57,877 ——> 00:39: 01,005
For the cancer to come back.

583
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,679
Yeah?

584
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,391
Okay. Okay.

585
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,436
Just relax. I'm coming.

586
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,784
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

587
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,288
If the DEA's tracking her barrels,
there goes our precursor connection.

588
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,832
That's done.
And I'm telling you, these days...

589
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,044
...chances of getting a new
methylamine hookup is rare, man.

590
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,962
It's like Bigfoot. Like unicorn-rare.

591
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:27,425
Kid, it's just....
You're giving me heartburn here.

592
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,261
GPS on the bottom of the barrel.

593
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,056
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

594
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,891
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

595
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,935
They made these things
to put under cars.

596
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,895
It can get wet.

597
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,982
Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.

598
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,567
And the other barrels...

599.
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,736
...they have trackers
on the outside too?

600
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,364
I don't know. Probably.

601
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,659
You didn't check
any of the other barrels?

602
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,912
No. But that's the only one
we could've taken according to her.

603
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,833
Once we spotted it, she freaked out,
I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.

604
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,835
Let me ask you something.

605
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,380
The person who spotted this...

606
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,131
-was it you or was it her?

607
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,717
Lydia. She saw it first.

 

608

00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,762
Okay.
609

00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,180

She's dead.

610

00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,015

Wait, wait, wait. What?

611

00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,102

Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.

612
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,689
She's thinking if she makes it look
like her inventory's being watched...

 

613
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,733
.that we'll leave her alone

and take our business elsewhere.

 

 

614
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,193
And she's right.

615
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,654
We will be taking our business
elsewhere.
616
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,115
-right after I leave her alone in a ditch.

617
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff...

618
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,246
...that's a good thing, right?
I mean, all we gotta do is tell her...

619
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,040
...to cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

620
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,917
You don't know this woman like I do.

621
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:46,254

I had a chance to deal with this before,

and I gave her a pass.

622
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,256
That's what I get for being sexist.

623
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,884
-Now, if you'll excuse me....
-Mike, you can't just--

624
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,387
Look, that's our precursor.

We need her.

 

 

625
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,016
Kid, if we have to ramp down

for a while, so be it.

626
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,686
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

627
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,274
Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you
know? She just seemed, like, uptight.

628
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,568
And now you're being sexist.

629
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:13,740
Trust me, this woman deserves to die
as much as any man I've ever met.

630
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,700
Wait!

631
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,577
Just wait.

632

00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,787
What if this really was the cops,
you know?

633

00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,707
-And what if you're wrong about her?
-I'm not wrong.

 

634
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,209
But what if you are?

635
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,088
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

636
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,799
Now move away from me.

637
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,010
No. This is a voting thing.

638
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,180
-I don't think so.
-I vote it's a voting thing.

639
00:42:37,388

Mr. White, weigh

00:42:39,849
What do

00:42:43,227
Mr.

00:42:53,237

--> 00:42:39,640
in here,

640
--> 00:42:41,517
you think?

641
--> 00:42:45,229
White?

642
--> 00:42:56,574

would you?

The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

643
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,494
We are not ramping down.

644
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,163
We're just getting started.

645
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,708
Nothing stops this train.

 

646
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,002
Nothing.
647
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:13,257
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.
648
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,471
Hey, I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.
649
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,765
You know, it's pretty....
650

00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,935
I think it's the way to go.

651
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,023
Oh, hey.

652
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,860

You said it was your birthday, so....

653
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,200
I left the receipt in the box
in case you wanna exchange it.

654
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,622
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

655
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,389
Hi.

656
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,774
I stopped by Hank and Marie's.

657
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:16,028
Junior is still asking,
"What is going on?"

658
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,573
Nonstop, very insistently.

659
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,783
But everything's okay.

660
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,828
They're watching Ratatouille.

661
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,497
It's very sweet.

662
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,168
How are you?

663
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,636
There's gonna be some more money
coming in soon.

664
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,471
Is that okay?
665
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,933
Fine.

666
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,518
Good.

667
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,190
So....

668
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,234
You coming to bed?

669
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,511
I wanna show you something.

670
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,641
See that watch?

671
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,268
It was a birthday present.

672
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,314
The person who gave me
this present...

673
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,274
..wanted me dead too.

674
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
Not that long ago...

675
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,156
..-he pointed a gun

right between my eyes, right here...

676
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,159
...and he threatened to kill me.

677
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,538
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler...
678
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,583
...and so will you.

Hi
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,088
Hey, man, look at the sad sack
I found moping around the lobby.

2
00202: 51,254 => 00:02:53,590
-Hey.
-Hey, there, Walt.

3
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,092
-How you doing, buddy?
-Good.

4
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,636
Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you
out of the blue.

5
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,763
-No, no, no.
-If it's a bad time, I could--

6
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,308
No. I'm just kind of settling into the new
digs here. What do you think?

7
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,185
It is very nice.

8
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,230
-Yeah. Congratulations again.
-Yeah.

9
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,066
-We're all very proud of you.
-Oh, well, thanks.

My days of chasing dirt-balls is over.

1
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,487
But I'll tell you what, being a boss...

 

2
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,864
...own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

13
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,661
Steve, would you mind if...? I've gotta
run something by Hank, if it's all right.

14
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,914
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

15
00203:26,081 =—> 00:03:28,917
-Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
-Thanks again, Steve.

16
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,086
-Appreciate it.
-Sure.

7
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,714
Hey. Look at that.

8
00#033 33,922 ==> 00:03: 35,632
Jesus, Walt.

9

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,467

-That's nice. Let me see that.
-Yeah.

 

20
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,386
Wow, that's beautiful.

21
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,472
-Was it a birthday present?
-Yeah.

22
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,016
Well, I mean, not really.

23
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,935
I bought it for myself.

24
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,606
-Hey, well, have a seat.
-Thanks.

25
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,360
New car, new watch.

26
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,945
Good for you.

27
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,865
With all the curveballs
that were thrown at you this year...

28
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,200
...you deserve to treat yourself.

29
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,662
I mean, as long as you got
the money to spend, that is.

30
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,873
So how's Sky?

Si.
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,460
Actually,
she went to work this morning.

32
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,253
She wanted to.

33
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,550
She said she needed to, you know,
keep her mind occupied, and....

 

34
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,427
-That's good. Great, actually.
-Yeah.

35
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,222
I mean, as long as you're all right
with her being on her own and stuff.
36
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,560
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm right there with her most of the time.

37
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,314
And Mariano kind of keeps an eye
on her when I'm not, so....

38
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,482
-Good.
-Yeah.

39
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,568
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

40
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,198
You know, Marie goes off about Dave
like he's a rock star shrink, you know?

41
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,659
They come in like zombies, out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

42
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,038
That's great.
Actually, she already found someone.

43
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,081
Yeah. Peters...

44
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,463
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank
on his last name. Peter....

45
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,466
Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho.
He's supposed to be top-notch.

46
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,428
Good, good. I'm glad you're on it.
That's not something you wanna let fester.
47
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,306
No. No, you don't. You don't.

48
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,144
Hank, I just....

49
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,981
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

50
O0#05215,148 => 00:05: 17,150
No, it's-- It really is--

51
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,610
No, it's nice of you.

52
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,822
And I'd like to come by tonight
and see them, if that's all right.

53
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,574
Of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

54
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,702
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

55
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,246
I appreciate that.

56
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
I do.

57
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,631
Something else on your mind there,
Walt?

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,092
Walt, feel free to, you know....

59
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,978
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

60
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,317
And I don't know what to do, Hank.
I. don: "tis

61
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,736
She....

62
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,410
She says that I'm a bad influence
on the kids...

63
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,205
»..and that I'm not....

64

00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,668
-Not good for them.
-Jeez, Walt.

65
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,628
No.

 

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,757
She thinks I'm a bad father.

 

67
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,010
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,972
Hey, I mean,
Sky and you got your issues...

69
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,851
«but that there, that's.... That"s....
70

00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,603
I mean, I'm no....

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,065
I'm not an expert on parenting
or anything, but from where I'm sitting...
72
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,400
...I just don't see it, you know?

73
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,194
I mean, I....

74
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,656
I think you're great with the kids.
I think you're great with the kids.

1D
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:52,078
You're a provider, a role model,
you know?

76
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,373

Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer...

77

--> 00:06:59,418
that's an inspiration to me,
you know?

00:06:55,540
...that alone,

78

--> 00:07:03,006
I've made mistakes, you know?
-Yeah. Yeah, I know.

00:06:59, 920
-No,

79
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,800
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

80
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,303
-Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
-I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

81
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,182
I'm gonna give you a moment
to just get it together there.

82
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,768
You want cream and sugar?
83
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,770
Yeah, yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,647
No, no, no.

85
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,441
That-- Cup of coffee, right? All right.

86
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,069
Just take a moment. Take a moment.

87
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,209
You know, you two
are really great together.

88
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,339
Take it from me, buddy,
it's always darkest just before the dawn.

89
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,633
Yeah.

90
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,766
What is this place? What is this place?
What are we doing here?

91
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,643
-Get me the table.
“=I can't be here.

92
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,105
My daughter, my little girl,
she's gonna be home soon.

93.
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,440
What? What are you doing?

94
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,569
-Mike, Mike, Mike--
-Shut up.
95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,662
Give me her phone.

96
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,334
All right, Lydia.

97
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,087
My friends here don't know you
like I do...

98
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,008
...SO they are very kindly
giving you one last chance.

99
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,348
There's your script. Study it.

100
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,853
In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial
Agent Schrader on your line here...

101
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,314
...and you're gonna pass along
this information...

102
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,983
...and then we'll see what we see.
Here are the rules:

103
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,445
If you yell for help, try to give the man
some kind of coded message...

104
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,948
+..or otherwise tip him off,
I am gonna pull out my pistol...

105
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,201
...and shoot you in the head.

106
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,120
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

07
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,164
Remember how you like to do that?

08
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,794
If it happens this time,
I am going to pull my pistol out...

 

09

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,214

...and I am going to shoot you
in the head.

110
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,840
Look at me, not at them.

mes ii
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,637
Lydia, look at me.

112
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,516
If you make Schrader suspicious
in any way...

I3
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,269
..-any way at all,
tell me what's gonna happen next.

114
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,981
-You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.
-And where will I shoot you?

115
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,442
-In the head.
-In the head. That's right.

116
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,070
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

117
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,572
I'm expecting precision here.

118
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,117
We up and running?

119
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah. Computer's set.

120
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,495
Okay, Lydia.

121
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,916
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime...

22
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,918
...it's now.
23

00210:28,.336 =-> 00:10:29,712
You're up.

24
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,050
ASAC's office.

 

25
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,011
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

26
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,721
I'm sorry. What's this regarding?

27
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:43,309
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

28
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,645
Hold, please.

 

29
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,774
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
on line one.

 

 

130
00210:52,944 ==> 00:10:55,113
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?
131
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,116
Well, this is kind of an odd....

132
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,704
It's just that I was in our warehouse,
supervising a shipment of chemicals...

133
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:07,167
-when I noticed a device on the bottom
of one of our barrels of methylamine.

134
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,587
-A device?

-Yeah. I guess you'd call it that. I mean...

135
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:16,050
'm certainly no expert,
but it looks to me like some kind of a.

136
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,304
A tracking device or a GPS.

137
00211:19,971 =-> 00:11:23,933
So I was just wondering
if maybe your people put it there.

 

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,770
Not that it's any of my business,

but the last thing I wanna do is interfere...

139
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,482
-with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

140
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,776
.or whatever you call it.

141
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,321
So I don't know...

142
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,865
..maybe you could
give me some guidance?

143
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,159
Well, I'll tell you what.

144
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,369
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would...

145
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,788
«cand. D'1ll look into it
and get back to you.

146
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,334
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

147
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.

148
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,922
Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. Quayle.

149
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,714
Bye-bye.

150
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,515
Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?

154
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,643
-Yeah?
-Hey, man.

152
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,521
You know anything about GPS trackers
on a methylamine barrel?

153
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,398
Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.

154
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
Nope. Nobody from my team
planted anything. Why?

155
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,488
Oh, I don't know. I figured as much.

156
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,448
All right. Thanks.

157
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,202
I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

158
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,497
-I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
-Shut up.

159
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,083
And there you have it, like I said.

160
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,252
All right. So now what?

161
00212 $32,418 ==> 00212: 36,089
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's
probably thinking some crew planted it...

162
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,424
...looking for a weak spot to pull a heist.

163
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,135
He's gonna send a team over

to that warehouse.

 

 

164
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,597
He's gonna wire it out the wazoo.
Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.

165
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,557
So the warehouse is too hot.

166
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,143
Her supply is useless to us now.

167
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,605
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

168
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,899
We're 900 miles closer, after all.

169
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,236
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

170
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,863
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there...

Le,
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,951
...use her security code to gain access
and we take every barrel we can.

172
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,705
U-Haul can only take six or seven
before the suspension gives out.

173
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,916
It's a stopgap. But right now,
it's the best we can do.

74
00%13213,918 =-> 00:13:16,546
Well, what about her?

75
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,718
You two drive the barrels back tonight.

76
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,595
I'll deal with her.

 

77
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,390
No. No, no, no.

You're making a mistake.
178
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,226
This was not me.
I swear to God I didn't do it.

179
002132 30,393 => 00:13: 33,021
I don't know.
Sounds like she's telling the truth to me.

180
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,149
She has a gun to her head, kid.

181
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,027
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep
with a gun to their head.

182
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,070
I'm sorry, Jesse.

183
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,449
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,659
It's two against one.

85
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,496
No. No! You can't kill me! Come on!

86
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,124
I swear I didn't do anything!

 

87
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,252
Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?

 

 

188
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,795
You got it.

189
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,302
Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.

190
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,680
He's on the line.

191
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,601
Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys
didn't do something as lamebrained...

192
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,229
-..as put a GPS tracker on the outside
of a barrel of methylamine.

193:
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,316
One earmarked for the
Madrigal warehouse in Houston?

194
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,028
Who's asking?
Did someone find them?

195
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,613
Jesus. Are you shitting me?

196
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,657
Since when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outside of a barrel?

197
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,243
We didn't have time
to go in with hazard suits, Hank.

 

 

198
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,536
They were about to ship.

199
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,122
We epoxied them to the bottom.
They were well-hidden.

200
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,666
Oh, really?
Well, not well-hidden enough.

201
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,168
How many barrels you tag?
202
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,213
All of them. All the ones headed
to the warehouse, anyway.

203
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,176
Christ. All right. Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.

204
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,804
Next time, a little communication first,
all right?

205
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,890
-Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
-Asshole.

206
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,605
Aside-- Aside from the fact...

207
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:02,485
...that we almost killed this woman,
all of those barrels are already marked.

208
002153 02,652 ==> 00215: 04,237
We solve the problem we can.

209
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,281
This has not changed the equation
one iota for her.

 

210
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,452
Oh, come on! You are not seriously
still considering killing me?

211.
O0815<¢11,619 ==> 0031.5: 14,831
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now.

212
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,418
I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.

213
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,546
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

214
O01 5:21, 712 ==> 00s1.5: 24,715
She is saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

215
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:29,554
I am telling you, she will turn a gun or
a badge on us the first chance she gets.

216
00215<30,012 => 00715: 34,267
The woman put a hit out on me.

217
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,103
Seriously?

218
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:42,233
Wait. A hit? What? Like the mafia?

 

219
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,111
Yeah, like the mafia.

220
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey! You still need methylamine,

don't you? Right?

221
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,158
You wanna talk methylamine?

222
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,953
Then tell your partner to stop
threatening me, and let's talk.

 

 

223:
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,414
Talk about what? You heard.

224
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,708
You can't even get us a single barrel.

225)
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,877
Who said anything about barrels?

226
00:16:01,043 --> 00:
I'm talking about an ocean

6:05,006
of the stuff.

227
00:16:11,387 --> 00:
Just give him a minute,

6:13,681
would you?

228
6:13,848 --> 00:
Trust him.

00: 6:15, 683

229
6:15,850 --> 00:
"Trust him."

00: 6:17,018

230
6:21,898 --> 00:16:25,067
Okay. So let's hear it.

00:

231
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,571
Not without a guarantee that once
I tell you how to get what you want...

 

 

232
00:16:28,738 =--> 00:16:30,031
...-I won't be killed anyway.

233

00:16:30,198
Fine. You

002163 31,991

--> 00:16:31,824
have my word.

234
=-> 00:16:33,951

-Not good enough.

-Look,

00:16:34,118

lady--

235
--> 00:16:37,955

-Do you have children?
-That has nothing to do with this.

00:16:38,122

236
--> 00:16:41,459

It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

237

00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,754

Yes,

I have children.

So what?
238
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,298
You think that somehow
because we're both parents...

23.9
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,800
...that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

240
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,552
-Swear on their lives.
-Oh, what?

241
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,222
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

242
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,265
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

243
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,894
Look, you're a smart businesswoman.

244
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,896
You understand the concept
of leverage.

245
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,108
-Please don't patronise me. I hate that.
-You have none.

246
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:14,075
But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.

247
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,119
Is it true that you put a hit out on Mike?

248
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,542
-Yes.
-Why?

 

 

249
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,918
I was scared.
250
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,214
-Of Mike?
-Not at first.

251
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,217
There are men who used to work
with Gus Fring in custody now.

252
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,220
Nine of them. They know everything
about me. Everything.

253
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,682
Some of them even know about you,
assuming you're the master chemist...

254
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,059
...they're always talking about.

255
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,230
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about...

256
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,566
-...why put the hit on Mike?
-I had no choice.

257
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm not going to prison and have my
daughter raised in a group home.

258
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,780
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

259
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,699
I gave him a list of names...

260
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,243
...but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.
261
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,246
So I hired someone else.
At that point, there was no option...

262
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,123
...but to add Mike to the list.

263
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,797
This ocean of methylamine...

264
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,092
...that you claim
you can get your hands on...

265
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,430
...how much are we
talking about, literally?

266
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,808
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

267
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,648
Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight
train leaves the Port of Long Beach...

268
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,734
...loaded with industrial chemicals.

269
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,778
There's always at least one tanker car

full of methylamine...

270
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,448
.-which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

 

 

27-1:
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,992
The train travels east through Arizona...

272
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,286

..stops at a rail yard outside Flagstaff...
273
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,123
..-where it gets broken down and rebuilt.
But the methylamine always moves on...

274
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,126
...destined for our pesticide concerns
in Texas and Oklahoma.

215
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,129
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

276
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:55,301
There's a remote three-mile stretch
here in McKinley County.

277
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,386
That's where you do it.

278
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,140
That's where we do what exactly?

279
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,558
Get your methylamine.

280
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,604
-Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?

-You want the stuff?

 

 

281
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,939
'm offering you enough
to fill a swimming pool.

282
O0219:09,106 =-> 00:19:12,485
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
That's what I'm hearing.

283
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,862
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

284
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,283
You have any idea how many alarms
that'll set off between here and D.C.?

285
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,204
None, if you do it right here.
If a freight train is stopped in transit...

286
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,748
...anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots...

287
00219:3.25,915 =-> 00:19:29,669
..-absolutely, a signal will alarm the FRA
and the TSA Surface Division...

288
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,005
...at the Department of Homeland
Security. But what you don't know...

289
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,884
...and I do, because my job requires me
to keep track of my buyers' shipments...

290
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,345
...-this is dark territory.

291
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,056
-What's that?
-Train-speak for an area of no contact.

292
00819: 42,223 => 00:19: 43, 891
It's a dead zone.

293
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,396
No automated supervision system,
no alarms, no contact with control.

294
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,772
What about cell phones?

295
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,608
-Crew could just call the cops.
-No cellular either.
296
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,611
I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.

297
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,780
You'd have time enough
to stop the train...

298
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,366
...Siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry...

299
002207 00,533 ==> 003208 03,911
-...get away before the police are called.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

300
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,706
Assuming we can stop a moving train...

301
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,418
...-how do we know we have the right one?
And which tanker car is which?

302
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,212
I can't believe that they would
advertise their contents.

303
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,589
Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff...

304
002207315, 756 ==> 00:20:18,592
..a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

305
00%20:18,759 ==> 00:20:21,595
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2 a.m.

306
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,432
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

307
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,769
Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

308
00220728,936 --> 00:20:30,187
I expect to be paid.

309
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,484
We can talk percentages later.

310
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,778
You know what this means, don't you?

311
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,405
We've gotta off the crew.

312
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,365
How do you figure?

 

313
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,826
If we don't, the engineer's
gonna call the cops...

314
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,288
»..as soon as he gets out of the
dead zone. It's only three miles long.

315
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,624
-We're out in the boonies.
-I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.

316
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,252
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security...

317
00220:53,419 ==> 00:20:57,256
...are gonna swoop down with choppers
on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.

318
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,884
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

31:9)
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,927
-How many in the crew?
-Just two.

320
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,264
-An engineer and a conductor.
-Assuming there are no security guards.

321
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,184
No guards. It's not like
we're carrying nuclear warheads.

322
00:21:08,350 =-> 00:21:10,352
Wait. Two guys.

323
00221:10,519 --> 00321:12,521
Can't we just tie them up
or something?

324
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:17,943
And then what? Even if we wear a mask,
we're leaving two witnesses behind.

325
00221:18,110 => 002212 21,322
Bottom line, I have done this
long enough to know...

326
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,325
...that there are two kinds of heists:

327
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,286
Those where the guys
get away with it...

328
00221:27,453 =-> 00:21:29,997
...and those that leave witnesses.

329
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,793
Give me a break.
You guys were gonna murder me.

330
008212 33,959 => 00212 36,378
I thought you were professionals.
331
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,301
Can you say "ASAC"?

332
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,553
"ASAC." Can you say that?

333
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,056
Say, "ASAC Schrader."

334
00821: 47,223 => 003212 51,268

If those turn out to be her first words,
I will beat you with my shoe.

 

 

335
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,356
-Don't listen to him, Holly.
-I'm just telling it like it is, babe.

336
008212557523 --> 00321: 57,858
Boss man. I'm the boss man.

337
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,110
Say, "Boss man."

338
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,696
Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.

339
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,325
Hey, that better be something from
a boob instead of some fake soy crap.

340
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,953
-Yeah, yeah.
-My little girl...

341
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,497
-Your little girl.
-...deserves the real McCoy.

342
00%22:12,665 ==> 00:22:13,833
-No. See?

-Okay.
343
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,752
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

344
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,088
She wants me.

345
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,134
Yeah, my little girl,
because I'm not giving her back.

346
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,636
Yeah, I know.

347
00%22:26,262 =-> 00:22:27,805
What about Emo McGee?

348
008222277972 --> 00322: 29,723
Has he come out of his room today?

349
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,225
Barely.

350
00222:31,392 --> 00:22:33,143
When he does, he barely talks.

351
00%22:33,.310 ==> 00:22: 35,437
Yeah, well, what do you expect,
you know?

352
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,732
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

353
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,702
Flynn, do you want me to heat up
some of that lasagne...

354
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,579
...to hold you over till dinner?
355
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,038
No.

356
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,709
Hey, I picked up Heat on Blu-ray.
Wanna watch it with me later?

357
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,839
No. And you can keep
talking about me now.

358
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,762
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

359
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,681
We do it the old-fashioned way.

360
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,268
We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace,
all the halfway houses...

361
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,063
...scrounge up about a dozen skells,
put them to work smurfing cold pills.

362
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,065
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

363
002235209232 == 002235 23, 986
You're the chemist. Admittedly,
it's gonna cut down on our output.

364
002233.24,153 =<> 00:23:26,572
Like a factor of four or five.

365
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,909
It also means
that we will eat $80,000...

366
00:23:30,075 =-> 00:23:32,453
..we just invested
in our new lab equipment...

367
00223232,620 --> 00:23:35,039
..-which is only good for a P2P cook.

368
002233 35,205 == 002233 37583
You know, I don't have to do
the math to know...

369
00223: 37,750 => 00:23:39,919
...that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

370
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:44,465
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

371
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,927
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

372
00223:48,093 => 00:23:51,221
Why is making nothing not an option?

373
003232517388 --> 00°23: 52,973
-Walter--
-Let me tell you why.

374
002232 53,140 <-> 00:23:55,309
It's because of your nine guys
in lockup, right?

375
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:59,146
You broke it, you pay for it. And we've
talked about this plenty already.

376
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,690
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more...

377
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,486
...because what it sounds like you're
telling me, Mike, is that from now on...

378
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,405
...we have no choice
but to do this piddling pseudo cook...

379)
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,616
...SO that we can pay back your guys.

380
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,078
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

381
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,289
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter...

382
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,875
...is that you wanna do this heist...

383
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,003
...even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

384
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,922
That what you want?

385
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,343
You know, I don't know why you insist
on putting words in my mouth here.

386
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,556
What if we can rip off that train,
and no one ever knows it got robbed?

387
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,739
Maybe.

388
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,955
Just maybe.

389
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,843
It'll come from that direction.

390
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,622
Seven seventy-five.

391.
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,794
Eight hundred.

392
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,009
Eight fourteen.

393
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,182
Wait a minute.

394
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:08,275
It's perfect. Yeah, we do it here.

395
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,320
We do it right here.

396
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,417
How are we looking, Mike?

397
002263 31,924 ==> 00226: 33,550
All clear.

398
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,385
Copy that.

399
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,020
Go down, go down.

400
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,524
You got it. That's good, Fernando.

401
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,999
Hey.

402
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,087
-This one.
-Right.
403
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,301
-You good?
-Yeah.

404
00227420,139 s=> 002273 22,057
-What's your name again?
-Todd.

405

--> 00:27:25,769

are you gonna be able
this climb?

00:27:22,224
on the day,
to make

Todd,

406

00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,355

Yes, sir. I'll be ready.
407
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,691
All right.
408

00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,777
-You mind if I ask you a question?
-No. Go ahead.

409
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,405
Well, I get why we want the tank
for the methylamine.

410
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,282
But why this other one for the water?

4
00:27:39,074

1

--> 00:27:40,784

Well ..ss

4

2

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,203

Jesse, it's
4
00:27:43,370
You wanna f

 

4

your idea.

3

--> 00:27:45,205

ill him in?

4

00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,457

It's all about

the weight, yo.
415
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,545
The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed
when it gets loaded in Long Beach...

416
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,840
...and then again
when it's unloaded in Texas.

417
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,758
If the weights don't match...

418
00227756,925 ==> 003273 59,178
...the train company's
gonna know it got robbed.

419
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,387
Okay.

420
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,557
Boosting methylamine from a train
is, like, a major rap.

421
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:09,938
The point is, no one other than us can
ever know that this robbery went down.

422
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,066
Nobody. You got it?

423
00228:15,194 ==> 00:28:17,321
Yeah. Absolutely.

424
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,697
Are you sure?

425
00%28:19,865 ==> 00:28:21,575
Yes, sir.

 

426
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:25,662
With all that said,
the whole thing relies on us...
427
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,458
..replacing the weight of methylamine
we steal with the same weight in water.

428
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,709
So they'll never know
we hit them. Cool.

429
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,881
Aqueous methylamine is water-based,
yet it weighs slightly less than water.

430
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:41,428
We will be removing a thousand gallons
of methylamine from the tanker car...

431
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:46,016
..but replacing it with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water...

432
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:50,020
...which comes to 900.24 gallons.

433
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,523
Actually, Jesse,
let's make that an even 920...

434
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,652
...to account for spillage
and whatever will remain in the hose.

435
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,363
-Yeah.
-How we doing, by the way?

436
00228:59,529 ==> 00:29:02,908
-Eight fifty. We're almost there.
-All right.

437
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,578
Won't they figure they got robbed,
getting watered-down methylamine?
438
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,956
Well, out of 24,000 gallons...

439
00:29:09,122 =-> 00:29:13,877
..-it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so....

440
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,964
But, yes, you're right. They will notice.

441
00229:17,130 --> 00:29:20,759
At which point, they will blame China...

442
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,554
...for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

443
00:29:25,055 =-> 00:29:28,350
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

444
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,151
Flynn.

445
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,238
Flynn, open the door.

446
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,324
Just come out and talk to me.

447
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:48,036
I'm staying. That's all I have to say.

448
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,837
-What's going on?
-You got what you wanted, that's what.

449
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,589
Congratulations.

450
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,020
It's me. Open up.

451
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,151
Come on, Junior.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

452
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,695
What?

453
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,905
You know what.

454
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,742
Are you seriously kicking me out
of my own house?

455
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,493
Are you seriously doing that?

456
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,954
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

457
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,083
We love you. And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

458
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,045
But your mom and I need some time
alone, and you know that.

459
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,006
-We explained that to you.
-You haven't explained jack shit.

460
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,092
You want me out? Explain to me why.

461
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,011
Why do I have to go to Uncle Hank's?

462
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,181
Give me the exact reason
or I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,726
This is not gonna be a debate.

464
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,436
What's going on?

465
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,605
Why can't anybody tell me anything?

466
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,524
I want one good reason.

4607
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,112
Because we're your parents
and you're our child.

468
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,074
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as ask.

469
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,119
Now.

470
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,958
It'll pass. He'll understand.

471
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,544
Don't start, Walt.

472
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,297
I won't change my mind about you.

473
00%317423,673 ==> 003318 25,384
Ever.

 

474
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,511
Well, I don't accept that.

You're my wife.
475
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,722
I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.

476
002312 31,723 ==> 00:31: 35,602
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned...

477
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,229
...I'll make you a deal.

478
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,066
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets...

479
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,902
...but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's...

480
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,822
..where they have
a chance of being safe.

481
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,618
I think you've seen too many movies.

482
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,123
Our children are not in danger.

483
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,500
Just a couple of days ago...

484

00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,086
...you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

 

485
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,464
You said it like it was a point of pride.

486
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,967
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me...
487
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:10,178
...there won't come a day
that somebody will knock on that door...

488
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,681
...-looking to harm you or me
or all of us.

489
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:17,060
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

490
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,148
You agree to that...

491
00%32:22,107 ==> 00332: 26,570
...and I will be whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

492
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,293
Okay.

493
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,301
By the way...

494
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,513
...you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho. Peter.

495
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,683
Last name is up to you.

496
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,811
Out burying bodies?

497
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,526
Robbing a train.

498
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,848
-Yeah?
-It's me.
499
00233¢ 37,724 --> 00733: 39,267
I've got it.

500
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,105

Okay, Mr. White, everything's set.

501
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,561
Hey, Wallace! Up ahead!

502
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,565
Stop the train now!

503
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,212
Stop!

504
00%36:12,.379 ==> 00:36:13,588
Stop the train!

505
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,608
Now. Go, go, go.

506
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,098
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

507
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,475

It'd be like pancake city out here.

508
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,769
Man.

509
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,771
Hey, you believe this?

510
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,982

I mean, shit fire and save the matches.

511
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,359
Talk about bum luck.

51.2
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,946
Hey, man, I'm sorry
to put you guys out like this.

513
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,448
What's the trouble with it?

514
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,533
No clue.
I was just driving down the road.

515
00237223,700 => 00:37: 26,453
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

516
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,581
Either one of you guys know about
engines? Oh, of course you do.

517
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,625
That's why they call you
an engineer, right?

518
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,422
-All right.
-Think it's....

519
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,299
Think it's in there or something.

520
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,508
-You think?
-Yeah.

521
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,802
Probably a pretty good bet.

522
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,015
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

523)
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,808
I don't know, man. I just drive it.
524
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,937
-Now. Go, go, go.
-We're on.

525)
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,060
-Good?
-Yeah.

526
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,395
Go!

527
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,128
It looks good up here.

528
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,921
Now, hold up. There it is.

529
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,382
I think this is the one.

530
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,593
-We good?
-Yeah.

531
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,304
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

532
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,431
All right, let me give it a try.

533
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,403
-Ready?
-Ready.

534
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,115
-Nothing?
-Try again.

535
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,121
-Nothing.
-All right.

536
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,623
Maybe if we all pushed?

537
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,626
All right. It's worth a try.

538
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,839
Any other ideas,
you just shout them out.

539
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,091
Not at the moment, I don't.

540
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,887
You coming?

541
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,973
So far, so good.

542
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,976
Give me a status.

543
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,231
We're at 300 gallons and counting.

544
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,028
Water is going....

545
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,616
Now.

546
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,703
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

547
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,048
-Good?
-Yeah.

548
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,967
All right.

549
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,438
One, two, three.

550
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,532
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

551
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,325
Yeah, man. Give me a little credit.

552
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,106
You sure you're not out of gas?

553:
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,692
I got a full tank here.

554
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,653
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

555)
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,032
Why don't we just keep going over it?

556
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,076
There's gotta be something
loose somewhere.

 

557
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,960
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell of a place
to break down.

558
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,047
I know, right? Crazy.
Hey, you know anything about engines?

559
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,550
Not a whole lot. I can push you off
the tracks at least.

560
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,844
Gee, I wouldn't want you
to mess up your ride.

561
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,514
-I'll go slow. Won't get a scratch.
-You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.

562
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,018
Hey. We're running late because of you.
The man said it was no problem.

563
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,395
Come on already.
And thank you, by the way.

564
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,273
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

565
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,842
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a Good Samaritan on the scene.

566
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,470
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

567
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,097
We're not done yet.

568
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,367
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get out of there.

569
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,298
-Thank you, mister. Much obliged.
-Glad we could work that out for you.

570
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,052
-Yeah, no problem.
-You want a ride into town?

oat
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,596
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

572
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,939
Walter, they are back in the locomotive.

573
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,609
If you do not abort right now,
you are gonna get us all busted.

574
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,289
-Ready?
-Yeah.

575
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,752
Mr. White!

576
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,885
Hey!

577
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,846
Hold it! Hold it steady!

578
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,310
Now!

579
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,648
Close it off! Close it off!

580
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:38,569
Todd! Get off! Get off!

581
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,480
Yeah, bitch!

582
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,525
-We did it.
-Oh, yeah!

583
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,568
Oh, mMy's «ses

584
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,115
-Okay, okay. Nice job.
-Yeah!

585
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,611
No! No! No!
586

00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,574
No.

1
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,124
You guys didn't tell me
this stuff smells like cat piss.

2
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,267
Man, shit happens, huh?

3
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,835
I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it.

4
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,672
Obviously, I guess you see it different.

5

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,759
Some of you.

But I didn't see any other choice.

6
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,970
I've been thinking about this all day,
going over it in my head...

 

7
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,473
..-and it was the only way.

8
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,768
Well, it's not like I wanted to.

9
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,103
The kid was on a dirt bike.
He could've just....

10
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,690
He could've gunned it and been gone
before we even had a chance to blink.

11
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,027
We never would've caught him.
I thought on my feet. I saw a threat...

12
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,655
-...and I took care of it.
-A threat?
13
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,158
The kid was waving at us.

14
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,619
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

15
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,121
-Yeah, but you don't know that.
-Yeah, I do.

16
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,958
-He didn't know what he'd seen.
-I didn't want to take that chance.

L7
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,545
The whole point of this was no one
was supposed to know we were there.

18
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,423
People weren't supposed to
know anything got robbed.

19
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,634
How could we let the kid go?

20
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,847
He made us. If I hadn't done what I did,
the mission would've failed. I'm real sorry.

21
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,851
I really am, but I....

22
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,815
But did I make a mistake, Mr. White?
Because to me, you know, respectfully...

23
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,818
...I was looking out for the team.
I didn't want to kill him.

24
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,736
You gotta believe that.

25
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,573
At the end of the day, it was him or us,
and I chose us.

26
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,409
And I would do it again.

27
00:05:27,452 =-> 00:05:29,538
Okay, look.

28
00305! 30,872 --> 007052 31,873
Todd...

29
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,586
..why don't you step outside for a few
minutes so we can talk this through?

30
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,255
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.

SL
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,175
But I just want to make sure that you
know that my priority is this business.

32
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,177
Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you.

33.
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,138
I want to be a real part of this.

34
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,934
All right? If you could just see that.
I'm motivated and I've got connections.

35
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,981
My uncle's got his hookups in prison

who I think could be a real help to us if....

36
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,326
Okay. That dude? Wack job.

37
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,038
-Let's just stick to the facts here.
-Facts? Oh, okay.

38
00206312,205 ==> 00:06: 14,332
How about the fact that he shot a kid?

39
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,501
A kid that he didn't need to shoot.

40
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,712
Well, the boy had seen us.

41
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,216
And, no, it didn't look like he knew
what he was seeing.

 

42
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,678
But what if he told somebody?

43
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,514
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

44
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,433
We can't know what someone--

45
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,437
Exactly. We can't know,
because Ricky Hitler there shot him.

46
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,190
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

47
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,609
We would've figured it out.

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,154
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

49
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,115
-Is that how we do business now?
-I understand you're upset.

50
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,744
And what was that crap about his uncle
with the prison connections?

51
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,789
It's just some bullshit intimidation move.
Come on.

52
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,209
It's true, though.
He does have some connections.

53
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,047
-Is this a problem?
-No. It's nothing to be concerned about.

54
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,466
It came up in the background
I did on him.

55
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,260
Didn't worry me then. He's just flexing.

56
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,140
All right.

57
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,226
It seems to me that
we have three options here...

58
00:07:15,393 =--> 00:07:17,312
...and none of which are ideal.

59
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,357
One, we fire Todd.

60
00207:20,523 ==> 00207: 23,860
-Yeah.
-I'm not a fan of this option...

61
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,906
...seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

62
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,493
And we'd most likely have to pay him
to keep quiet.

63
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,704
And God only knows
we've got enough of that going on.

64
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,083
Two...

65
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,752
..we dispose of him.

66
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,845
Which leaves us option three.

67
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,847
We keep him on payroll.

68
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,601
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

69
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,021
We keep him close. Under our control.

70
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,068
Now, option three would be my choice.

71
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,278
Shall we vote?

72
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,200
I vote three, kid.

73
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,843
You're still in.

74
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,391
Right on. Thank you so much.
You guys totally made the right--

75
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,479
The next time you bring a gun to a job
without telling me...

76
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,025
...I will stick it up your ass sideways.

77
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,820
-You understand?
=Yes, Sit.

78
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,127
Hey, boss. What's up?

719
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,255
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

80
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,674
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,718
Well, isn't that sweet?

82
00209:54,219 ==> 00:09:55,929
Here, let me see.

83
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,720
It's a dead drop.

84
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,180
-What?
-A dead drop.

85
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,850
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

86
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,061
Write the time down. Roll on it.

87
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,942
Looks like he's leaving.

88
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,780
-Anybody coming for it?
-Nope, not that I can see.

89
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,367
Nobody in sight. Could be hours.

90
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,035
Could be.

91
OO#11L: 01,870 <> 00112 03,580
What do you want to do?

92
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,915
It's not my fault that Murtha's got
his panties in a twist.

 

 

93
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,417
It's an HR issue, Janice.

94
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,127
I read the report.

95
O0811751,294 ==> 00:11:55,089.
I'm calling again because that's
the wrong case file number.

96
00:11:55,256 =-> 00:11:57,926
All right? I don't know what kind of
shoddy stan--
97
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,638
First off, Miracle Whip
is not mayonnaise, okay?

98
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,098
"Looks like it" doesn't equal
"tastes like it."

99
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,269
Secondly, every time it's like
they gotta slather an entire jar--

100
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,523
--bastard's screwing with us now.
How'd he make you? What'd you do?

0.1,
00%12712,690 ==> 00:12:14,525
We honked our horns
and yelled "yoo-hoo."

02
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,570
What do you mean, what did we do?
This guy is slippery as hell.

03

00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,738

He's been throwing every tail
we put on him.

 

04
00#122159,906 <> 00s122 24,1619
-The guy's a pro.
-Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.

105
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,456
One of these days,
our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.

106
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,084
Just gotta be there when he does.

107
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,133
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.
00:12:41,678

Oh, you know. Well,

need them to be safe.
34
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,343
The kids?
35
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,096

They're safe.

 

 

 

 

Of course they are.

36
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,682
I just miss them so much.
37
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,476
I just want to be with them.
38
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,562
Hey, you know we can bring

them back home anytime you want.

 

 

39
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,691
No. They need to stay. But I just....
40
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,196
I don't know what to do here. I....
4l
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,283
Like, whatever choose is wrong.
42
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,997
Skyler, you gotta tell me
what's going on.
43
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,168
I know sometimes you--
44

 

00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,048
I know you think
I have a big mouth sometimes. I....
145
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,720
But if you felt like you couldn't talk to me,
I don't know what I'd do.

146

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,393

Okay.

So,

what's this about

the kids not being safe?

47
53,559 ==> 00214: 56,896

57,730 --> 00:14:59,816
From us.
49
01,067 --> 00:15:02,985
From Walt and me.

5:37,895
I will.

 

Skyler, you ha

ve
to forgive yourself for Ted.

159
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,027
-What?
-You can't keep beating yourself up...

160
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,698
...over some stupid little affair.

161
O0e 15s 51,159 => 0021.5: 53,161
-Walt told you.
-Please don't blame him.

I practically forced him to,
and I wasn't gonna say anything.

163
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,460
But cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

164
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,628
You have to forgive yourself, Skyler.

165
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,839
You were having all these problems
with Walt.

166
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,675
And Ted is a really good-looking man.

167
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,555
You're only human.

 

 

Hell, I've even thought of, you know....

168
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,394
I mean, not seriously,
but I totally get your temptation.

169
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,855
Yeah.

170
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,695
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

 

71

00%16:29,155 ==> 00:16: 31,032
Oh, yeah.

72

00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,994
-I feel better.
-Yeah.
73

00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,295
For those who love the taste
but not the price...

174
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,673
...there's simulated caviar made of kelp,
a type of seaweed.

175
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,138
A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells
and tastes similar to the real thing.

176
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,723
Ready to get back at it?
177
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
Unlike fish caviar--
178
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,230
We have breaking news
into our newsroom.
179
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,107

 

 

We've just learned
police are now expanding their search...

180
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,361
...for a missing McKinley County boy
after four days with no leads.

181
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,532
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

182
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,951
Authorities are extending
their search today...

183
O02T7 s 15,117 == OOST7s 18,079
...east from Crownpoint
to Hospah and Whitehorse.

184
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,333
Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike
into the desert behind his house.

85
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,752
Investigators are asking any--

86
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,722
Jesse, nothing can change this.

87
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,894
-Yeah, it's just that kid's parents....
-I know. Believe me.

 

88
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:47,024
I haven't been able to sleep the
past few nights just thinking about it.

189

00217:47,525 =<> 00:17:51,821
But, Jesse, now,
finally, we're self-sufficient.

190

00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,906
Finally we have everything

that we need...

 

191
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,451
...and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

192
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,330
And in a year, a year anda half...
193
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,584
...once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money...

194
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,005
...there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching. Until then...

195
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,674
...we keep going.

196
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,428
And we run our business our way...

197
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,390
...and make sure
that this never happens again.

198
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,768
Okay?

1:99
00:18:23,978 =-> 00:18:25,187
Look.

200
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,940
Listen, I'll finish this up.

201
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,610
Why don't you go on home?

202
002182 31,319 --> 00:18:33,821
-You sure?
-Absolutely.

 

 

203
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,449
Yeah. I'll take care of this.

204
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,495
You go on.

205
00319:23,412 =-> 00:19:24,955
Hey.

206
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,709
Yeah, I was just leaving.

207
00319: 30,252 =-> 00:19:31,712
All right.

208
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,782
Hello? Walter?

209
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,076
What are you doing here?

210
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,162
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

211.
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,042
Might as well get this over with.
Come in. Join us.

212

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,634
-Hey.
-Hi.

213
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,638
Where's your cars?

214
00220:22,805 ==> 00:20:25,266
We parked around the block.

215
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,644

You might consider

2
00:20:31,021

doing that as well.

6

=-> 00:20: 32,732

Okay.

2
00:20:43,200
So, what's

7

--> 00:20:44,535

going on?

 

2

8
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,914
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

219
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,916
-What?
-The feds have been all over me.

220
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,878
This has been going on
for a while now.

22.1,
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,504
Did they follow you here?

222
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,631
No. I said I threw them.

223
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,093
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation...

224
00%21:01,260 ==> 00:21:03,095
...dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.

225

00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,681
-It would be unwise.
-How can you be so sure?

22:6
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,727
Well, I've been doing this a long time.
It's pretty basic stuff.

227
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,480
How long has this been going on?

228
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,483
Since about the time we started

this little venture.

 

 

229
00%21:15,649 ==> 00:21:19,153
The DEA, in particular your peach
of a brother-in-law...
230
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,864
..-has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

231
00221422,031 => 00:21:24,325
And you're just telling me this now?

232
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,328
What, you didn't think this information
would be of interest?

233
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,247
-Wouldn't be germane?
-I've been handling it, Walter.

234
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,542
We're sitting on a thousand gallons
of stolen methylamine.

235
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,711
Jesus.
How can you be so irresponsible?

236
00221:35,878 ==—> 00:21: 37,463
Calm down, would you, please?

237
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,091
I can't believe you kept this from me.
From us. Did you know about this?

238
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,677
-Mike just told me.
-And I said calm down.

23.9
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,639
-I've got it under control.
-Oh, well, forgive me...

240
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,350
...for not having complete confidence.

241
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,686
-You know this can't go on, right?
-Yeah, I know.

242
002212 52,853 ==> 0021: 55,397
And I've already decided.

243
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,983
I'm out.

244
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,787
Okay. Well....

245
00222211,288 --> 00:22:13,457
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

246
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,001
But I really don't see any other way.

247
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,628
Neither do I.

248
00222:17,795 =-—> 00:22:19,213
Obviously, Jesse...

 

249

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,925
...you'll have to take over

the distribution end of things.

 

250
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:28,180
Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up
to speed on your side of the business?

251
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,141
Yeah, about that....

252
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,144
Actually, Mr. White...

253
00%22:35,729 ==> 00:22: 37,898
wo ok'M OU LOO.
254
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,360
You're what?

255
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,365
I don't think I can do this anymore.

256
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,493
So...

257
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,204
...I'm retiring, I guess.

258
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,374
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal?

259
00222:57,042 => 00:23:01,881
That methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

260
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,426
And you're telling me that you're willing
to walk away from that?

261
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,511
We're walking away from the meth.

262
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,013
Not the methylamine.

263
002233 09,179 --> 007232 12,057
Jesse and I will be taking
our two-thirds and selling it.

264
00:23:12,516 =-> 00:23:15,269
I've got a connection,
a guy I knew from my time with Fring.

265
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,607
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.
266
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,985
Mike's thinking we'll clear
like 5 million. Each.

267
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,447
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

268
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,910
And those legacy costs you're so fond of
you won't have to worry about anymore.

269
005234 31,076 --> 00%23% 33,579
And then I will be going on my way.

270
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,080
Jesse too.

271
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,584
It's a solid plan.

272
00223: 38,751. =-> 00:23: 41,837
You can come in on this with us.

273
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,881
That'd be cool.

274
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,886
Course, you know,
you are free to hold onto your third...

2715
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,221
...and keep cooking.

276
00223256,060 ==> 00:28:58,395
You'll be selling to my competitors.

277
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,023
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

278
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,692
It's a big country, Walter.

279
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,278
Whole lot of meth-heads.

280
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,073
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

281
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,575
And that's what you're
gonna sell out for?

282
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,787
Pennies? Why?

283
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,873
Five million isn't pennies.

284
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,708
It's more money than I've ever seen.

 

285
00224 220,167 = 008243 22, 7LL
And when it comes down to it...

286
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,172
...are we in the meth business...

287
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,508
...or the money business?

288
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,022
Relax, kid. There's no one there.

289
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,983
You sure?

290
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,860
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

291
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,267
Glad to see you could make it out.

292
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,644
I was surprised to get your call.

293
00925420,811 => 00:25:22,855
Good surprise, I hope.

294
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,108
There's one gallon, as discussed.

295
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,777
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

296
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,448
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

297
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,116
All right. That's fair enough.

298
00225: 34,283 =—> 00:25: 36,076
Shall we talk money?

299
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,412
That one's free.

300
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,290
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per.

301
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:46,211
Six hundred and sixty-five gallons,
that's 9,975,000.

302
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,465
Although I would prefer
you round it up to 10.

303
002252 49,631. => 00:25:52,926
Makes it easier for my partner
and I to split.

304
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,136
steep.

305
00825756,3805 ==> 002253 57,973
We good?

306
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,352
I'll talk to my guys, but I should be able
to put together that cash, yeah.

307
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,604
Good.

308
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:08,650
I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to get
that blue stuff of yours off the market.

309
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,949
The blue stuff will be off the market,
right?

310
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:24,249
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666...

311
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,294
...that seems like an odd number.

312
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,254
Two-thirds of an even thousand,
though.

313:
00%26:29,421. => 00:26:33,759
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

314
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,386
That's not all the methylamine, is it?

 

315
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,183
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

316
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,813
This other party
wouldn't be a problem for you.

317
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,066
-His territory won't impact yours.
-See, that doesn't work for me.

318
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,903
I'm not just buying this for the supply.
I'm buying this for the demand.

319
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,072
I'm looking to increase my market share.

320
00%26:55,239 ==> 003263 57,241
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

321
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,370
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue will be off the streets.

322
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,462
All right.
Here's a new deal for you then.

323:
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:15,175
I'll pay you 15K a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

324
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,594
Not a drop less.

325
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,224
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

 

326
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,352
Well, then, no deal, Mike.

327
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,169
Yes?

328
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,923
Yes. I guess.

329
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,760
I don't know.

330
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,180
Why don't you come over here?

331
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,183
To my house.

332
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,769
Yes, seriously.

333
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,236
Hey.

334
00%28:22,117 ==> 00:28:24,953
Yo, you sure this is okay?

335
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,664
She's not here. Nobody's here.

336
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,793
All right. So....

337
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,171
Something's come up.

338
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,757
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell...

339
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,928
...-but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

340
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,097
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares...

341
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,059
...of the methylamine
unless he gets your share too.

342
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,187
He wants the entire thousand gallons.

343
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,689
Absolutely not.

344
00228:53,232 —--> 00328:55,'692
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

345
00:28:55,859 =-> 00:28:59,613
But I've been thinking about it...

346
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,406
...and it really makes sense.

347
00:29:01,573 =-> 00:29:03,992
-Kind of.
-It does, does it?

348
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,537
Look, when you started this thing...

349
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,374
..-did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

850
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,459
I know for a fact that you didn't.

351
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,838
I know for a fact all you needed
was 737,000...

352
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,050
...because you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

353
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,596
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed...

354
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,557
...then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

B55
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,393
And we could have it tomorrow.

356
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,062
We would be out.
You could spend time with your family.

357
00929732,229 => 00729: 35,732
No more worrying about them getting
hurt or finding out about everything.

358
00229:35,899 => 00:29:37,734
Isn't this what you've been working for?

359
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,320
I have not been working this hard
just to sell out.

360
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,116
-It's not selling out.
-Yes, it is, Jesse.

361
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,662
I have-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

362
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,332
And I will not throw it away for nothing.

363
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,503
I don't know how else to say it,
Mr. White.
364
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,549
Five million dollars isn't nothing.

365
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,554
Jesse, have you heard of a company
called Gray Matter?

366
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,766
-No.
-Well, I co-founded it...

367
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,436
...in grad school
with a couple of friends of mine.

368
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,896
Actually, was the one who named it.
369

00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,649
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

370
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,901
We had a couple patents pending.

 

 

371
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,446
But nothing earth-shattering.

372
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,074
Course, we all knew the potential.

373
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,120
Yeah, we were gonna take
the world by storm.

374
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,875
And then this....

375
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,961
Well, something happened
between the three of us.
376
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,423
And I'm not gonna go into detail.

377
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,510
But for personal reasons,
I decided to leave the company.

378
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,847
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

379
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,642
I took a buyout for $5000.

380
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,730
Now, at the time,
that was a lot of money for me.

381
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,525
Care to guess what that company

is worth now?

382
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,487
Millions?

383
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,865
Billions, with a "B."

384

00231:07,699 =-> 00:31:11,078
Two-point-one-six billion

as of last Friday.

 

385
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,663
I look it up every week.

386
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,666
And I sold my share...

 

387
00231:16,833 =-> 00:31:21,671
..my potential, for $5000.
388
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,927
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

389
00231:28,053 --> 00:31:29,596
This isn't the same thing.

390
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,268
Jesse, you asked me...

39.1,
OO#3L: 35,435 <> 00s312 39,231
..if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

392
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,108
Neither.

393
00231:42,317 => 00731: 44,319
I'm in the empire business.

394
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,159
I don't know.

395
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:58,083
Mr. White, is a meth empire
really something to be that proud of?

 

 

396
00:32:11,555 =-> 00:32:13,348
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

397
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,892
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

398
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,645
Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you.

399
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,148
You have a lovely home.

 

400
00232:21,356 --> 00:32:24,025
-I was just heading out.
-Why don't you stay for dinner?

401
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,987
-No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
-Stay.

402
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,282
Come on. It'll be fun.

403
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,993
It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler?

404
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,246
We don't have anything special
planned tonight.

405
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,667
Yeah.

406
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,170
Sure.

407
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,924
Why not?

408
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,262
See?

409
00#33214,743 => 00:33:17,579
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

410
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,833
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

411
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,794
My mom always made them like that.

412
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,379
You put lemon in there too?
413
002338 27,547 --> 00733: 32,260
They are from the deli at Albertsons.

414
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,557
Well...

415
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,978
...you know, good work
on your shopping then.

416
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,607
Because these are choice.

417
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,000
I eat a lot of frozen stuff.

418
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,003
It's usually pretty bad.

 

419
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,589
I mean, the pictures
are always so awesome, you know?

420
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,467
It's like, "Hell, yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

421
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,054
And then you nuke it,
and the cheese gets all scabby on top...

422
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,640
..-and it's like you're eating a scab.

423
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,934
I mean, seriously, what's that about?

424
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,146
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

425
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,983
You know?

426
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,745
Yeah, it's bad.

427
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,252
So, hey, how's business?

428
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:52,340
The car wash.
Mr. White said it's going really well.

429
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,719
Says, like, you're a great manager.

430
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,014
He did, huh?

431
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,058
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a....

432
00%35702,225 ==> 003353 05,395
Like a machine. Like, well-oiled.

433
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,188
Yeah.

434
00%35710,609 ==> 003353 13,570
What else did he tell you about me?

435
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,282
Oh, you know, just good stuff.

436
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,327
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

437
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,204
We don't really talk that much about...
438
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,251
...you know, personal things.

439
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,798
Did you also tell him about my affair?

440
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,861
May I please be excused?

441
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,544
You know my kids are gone?

442
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,254
Thank God.

443
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,300
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

444
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:21,680
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

445
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,891
She made me kick
my own kids out of the house.

446
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,982
She told me...

447
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:39,114
...that she was counting the days
until my cancer came back.

448
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,994
My wife is waiting for me to die.

449
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,418
This business is all I have left now.

450
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,174
It's all I have.

451
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,931
And you want to take it away from me.

452
00:37:27,120 =--> 00:37:29,914
I thought you might try
something stupid.

453
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,834
-Look, Mike--
-Don't bother, Walter.

454
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,128
Come join me in the office.

455
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,007
I don't think so.

456
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,510
That's not a request.

457
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,894
Might as well get comfortable.
This deal's going down tomorrow.

458
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,730
It's happening, and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

459
00237 453,897 ==— 00737: 55,982
-Got it?
-So it's okay for you to steal my--

460
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,443
To ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend...

461
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,696
...the rest of the night together
in this office.

462
00:38:01,863 -->
-Like it's my
-Mike.

463
00:38:04,282 -->

00:38:04,115
birthday.

00:38:07,285

When the deal is done,

you'll get your money.

464
00:38:07,452 -->

I guarantee that.

00:38:11,414

Let me cook it.
I'll double your five and you still walk.

465

00:38:11,581 -->
You know,
work so hard not to

466
00:38:15,502 =->

Mike, you need to
467
00:38:17,128 -->

No, Walter.

468
00#38:55,083 =-—>

00:38:15,335

I have never seen anybody

get $5 million.

00:38:16,961
listen to me.

00:38:22,425

The last thing I need to do
is listen to you. Now,

sit down.

00:38:56,709

All right.

469
00:38:56,876 -->
Walter,

00:38:59,379

I've got a bit

of a quandary here.

470
00:38:59,546 -->

00:39:03,341

I've got something I need to attend to
before this deal happens.

471
00:39:03,508 -->
But for some reason,

00:39:07,428

I don't trust you

alone with the methylamine.

472
00:39:08,596 -->
I'm gonna have to

473
00239:11,641 =->
You gotta be

00:39:11,099
restrain you.

00:39:13,226
kidding.
474
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,104
Stand up for me, please.

475
008392 16,271 “> 00:39: 18,022
Stand up.

476
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,776
Turn around for me.

ATT
00239:22,193 =-> 00:39:24,863
Arms out to the side. Up.

478
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,547
-Oh, man.
-Sit down.

479
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,675
Sit down.

480
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,638
Give me your wrist.

481
00:39:58,313 --—> 00:39:59,522
Sorry.

482
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,819
Alrighty.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

483
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:57,366
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

484
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,951
This should be good.

485
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:03,331
Mr. Ehrmantraut has become
the subject of a vicious, relentless...

486
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:07,543
...and unwarranted DEA persecution.

487
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,215
-Gomie, does that sound right to you?
-I have no idea what he's talking about.

488
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,050
Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.

489
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:17,470
But we all know you've been following
my client day and night.

490
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,348
The man can't spend a few minutes
with his granddaughter...

491
00243220,515 ==> 003433 22,892
..-without you guys quivering
in the bushes...

492
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:28,439
...and peeping through your binoculars.
It's.... Well, it's disturbing.

493
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,277
And it's taken a toll on his mental
and physical well-being.

494
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,488
Your client looks fine to me.

495
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,826
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

496
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,955
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

497
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,918
Theoretically, these tails you refer to
would be within the bounds of the law.

498
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,713
Don't need a warrant to follow somebody
through a public place. Theoretically.

499
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,800
Yeah, that is theoretically correct.

500
00:43:55,967 --> 00:44:00,096
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance...

501
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:03,850
..-like this amounts to stalking.

502
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,601
Which is illegal.

503
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,271
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting...

504
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,940
...about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

505
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:15,444
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

506
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,781
So I have filed for a temporary
restraining order...

507
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:24,328
...against the DEA
on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

508
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,457
Where'd you get your law degree,
Goodman?
509
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,544
The same clown college
you got that suit?

510
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,547
You know who likes this suit?
Judge Papadoumian.

511
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,465
She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.

5.12

00:44:36, 632

--> 00:44:38,509

You know what

Judge Papado

5

umian hates?

3

00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42, 638

f a senior citizen.

--> 00:44:44,724

Lys

00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,809

Expect a visit from

the sheriff, agents.

6

00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,396
You should have your ex parte

00:

7

44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,982

Let's go.

5

What kind

00:45:03,284

45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,117

this thing?

 

9

--> 00:45:06,703

Papadoumian, man.
She's like Ho Chi Minh.

520

OO:

So, what

45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,289

do we do?
624.
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,959
Well, not a lot of choice, you know?
We back off.

522
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,588
For the moment. TRO won't stand up
and Goodman knows it.

523
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:19,759
I don't see what they're playing at here,
but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight...

524
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,220
-...he's gonna get one.
-All right.

525
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,721
-That was a hell of a gamble.
-Worked.

526
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,516
Yeah, well, not for long.

527
00%45:27,683 ==> 003453 31,229.
And he's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed tout de suite.

528
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,941
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

529
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,692
So have fun with that.

530
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,070
How much time I got?

531
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,073
Maybe 24 hours.

532
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,532
It's enough.
533
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,827
It better be. Whatever you got planned,
you best pull the ripcord...

534
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,996
..- while you still have a chance.

535
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,928
-Where is it?
-Mike....

536
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,429
-Mike!
-Get out of my way.

537
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,599
-You sit down.
-Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?

538
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,310
-I am gonna count to three.
-Mr. White's got an idea.

539
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,479
-I'm serious. It's a great idea.
-One. Two.

540
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:17,483
Look, you get your 5 million, we both do,
and he gets his methylamine, all right?

541
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,443
Just hear him out.

542
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,367
Is that true, Walter?

543
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,748
Everybody wins.

i
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,776
There.

2
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,737
That's them.

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,043
Your play, Walter. You're on your own.

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,853
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons
light here, Mike.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,564
Where's the juice?

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,525
The methylamine isn't coming.

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,612
Why is that?

8
O0801<s11,738 ==> 00:01314,575
-And who the hell are you?
-I'm the man who's keeping it.

 

 

9
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,452
What the hell's this?

10
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,163
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,665
So where's the tank, Mike?

12
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,585
Mike doesn't know where it is.
Only I do.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,587
And you're dealing with me now,
not him.

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,006
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want...

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,592
...or what you think
is gonna happen here, all right?

16
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,594
Because we're gonna get
what we came for.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,805
That 1000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands...

18
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,850
.than it is in yours or anyone else's,
for that matter.

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,562
But I need distribution.

20
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,230
Distribution.

21
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,149
That's right.

22
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,986
So if you agree
to give up your cook...

 

 

23
O0S01<¢51,153 ==> 003014 53,655
...and sell my product instead...

24
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,991
-I'll give you 35 percent of the take.

C23)
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,909
Thirty-five percent?

26
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,037
Wow, are you kidding me?
Thirty-five--

27
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,123
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,585
Know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,380
Why the hell would we want you? You
know we have our own operation, right?

30
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,841
I know all about your operation.

31
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,303
See, my partners here tell me
that you produce a meth...

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,765
...that's 70 percent pure,
if you're lucky.

33
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,186
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.

34
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,687
So?

35
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,861
So it's grade school T-ball...

36
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,447
..versus the New York Yankees.

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,867
Yours is just some tepid...

38
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,454
...off-brand, generic cola.

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,249
What I'm making is Classic Coke.

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,877
All right. Okay.

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:53,715
So if we just waste you
right here right now...

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,425
...and leave you in the desert...

43
00202255,592 --> 00702: 58,387
...then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

44
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,056
See how that works? There's only us.

45
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,976
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca-Cola?

46
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,365
My partner tells me that your crew...

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,576
...Sswitched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,204
You dye your meth with food coloring
to make it look like mine.

49
00#03225,372 => 00:03: 29, 501
You already ape my product
at every turn.

50
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,545
But now...

51
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,297
..you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

52
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,882
I need you to listen to me.

53
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,968
We're not gonna give up this deal...

54
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,096
...to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

55
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,473
For what?

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,767
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

57
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,479
A better high
means customers pay more.

58
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,568
A higher purity means a greater yield.

59
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,113
That's 130 million dollars of profit...

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,284
...that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,578
Now you listen to me.
62
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,832
You've got the greatest meth cook in A--
No, the two...

63
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,879
..-.greatest meth cooks in America
right here, and with our skills...

64
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,007
...you'll earn more
from that 35 percent...

65
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,800
...than you ever would on your own.

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,136
Yeah. So you say.

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,305
Just wondering why we're so lucky.

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,557
Why cut us in?

69
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,143
Mike is retiring from our crew...

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,896
...SoO his share of the partnership
is available...

71
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:36,193
...if you can handle his end,
distribution...

72
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,655
..-and if you give him 5 million dollars
of the 15 million that you brought today.

73
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,826
Just think of it as a finder's fee
for bringing us together.

74
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:50,248
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship, ready to go.

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,126
Are you ready?

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,981
Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,275
You know.

78
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,987
You all know exactly who I am.

719
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,158
Say my name.

80
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,412
Do what? I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

81
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05: 32,874
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.

82
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,546
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

83
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,549
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.

84
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,509
Are you sure?

85
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,104
That's right.

86
00305:54,271 =-> 00:05: 58,233
Now, say my name.

87
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,323
You're Heisenberg.

88
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,494
You're goddamn right.

89
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,615
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

90
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,245
Hey.

91
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,081
I appreciate the kind words...

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,335
..-but I'm out too, remember?

93
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,254
I know. We'll talk.

94
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,803
Maybe we should talk about how and
when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.

95
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,889
And we will do that.

96
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,557
Absolutely.

97
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,351
It's just, you know--

98
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,562
Look, Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

 

99
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,899
I'll need help getting things
up and running during this transition.

100
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,360
You can at least do that for me, right?

101
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,324
Come on. Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

102
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,775
Well, I guess that's it.

103
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,819
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two:

04
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,821
First, as I: said...«

05

00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,156

...I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end...

 

06

00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,494
...SO you won't have to worry about
my guys anymore. Second, the bug.

107
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,914
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when, could be anytime.

108
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,960
But you need to get it out of there,
sooner rather than later.

109
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,297
All right.

110
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,216
That's it?

1141
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,723

No "thanks for the 5
"sorry for chaining

million dollars," no
you to a radiator"?

2
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,393
Just get the bug, Walter.
3
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,027
So, hey.
4
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,281
I guess....
5

00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,408

 

I guess I'll see you around.
6
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,994
No. Don't think so.
7
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,204
When I'm out, I'm out.
8
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,208
Well, I'm out too, Mike.
9

00:09:04, 961
Kid, just look

--> 00:09:09,382
out for yourself.

 

20

=> 00:09: 56,221.
we good?

tell me.

00709:53,218
-Are
-You

121
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,766
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.

122
00%10702,393 ==-> 00:10:06,397
You're good. Keep it coming.
Straight back.

123
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,274
Slow it down.
24
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,318
All right. That's good.
25
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,618
Hey, Mrs. White.
26
002102 31,297 --> 00:10:33,091
"Vamonos."
27
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,844
I wish.
28
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,763
All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.
29
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,141
Walt.
30
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,064
What is this?
3.1,
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,441
Do you really wanna know?
32
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,238

-Why are you hiding it here?
-Don't worry about it.

 

 

33
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,990
Who are you hiding it from?
34
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,826
I said don't worry about it.
35
008107 59,993 s=>' 002118 01,119.
From the police?
36
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,414
Or someone else?
37
O02T1 $05,331, == 002113 07,208
Someone who would kill for it?

138
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,502
Why don't you go back in the office?

139)
O02T1 sli, 713 == OOSTI1s 15,383
Why don't you go back in the office
and let us do this?

40
00211:15,550 => 00:01:17,635
We'll get it out of your hair.

41
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,960
What'd you bring me this time?

42
00211:51,127 =-> 00:11:52,754
They're bacon banana cookies.

43
OOS 112 52;921, -->. 00311: 55,965
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!

44
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,884
Just bits. Just little bits of bacon.

 

 

45
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,719
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

 

 

 

146
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,765
Dan, this is too much.

147
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,058
I'm not sharing those.

148
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,143
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

149
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,812
-They're mine.
-They're yours to do with as you please.
150
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,731
Good, because my husband's
not getting any either.

151.
00212:12,899 ==> 00:12:15,026
-How is Mickey?
-Don't get me started.

152
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,694
He wants to buy a boat.

153
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,614
I can't even get him
to start the lawn mower...

54
00%12:19,.781. => 00:12: 21,783
-and he wants to buy a boat.

55
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,910
I don't know. A boat might be nice.

56
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,912
A little one, maybe.

 

 

 

57
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,957
Oh, please.

Where would you even take a boat?

158
00312:29,123 =-> 00:12:31,584
All the way down to Elephant Butte?

159
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,921
Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there.

160
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,007
You can even leave it at the lake
if you don't want to haul it.

161
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,136
We're not buying a boat,
I'll tell you that right now.
162
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,557
-And the last one is 545.
-569.

163
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,270
-Dang it. I almost got them all that time.
-Very good.

164
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,399
But actually, I've got an extra one
for you this week. 603.

165
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,194
-603. Where is that?
-Right down there.

166
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,659
All right. I'll let you get to it.

167
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,452
Thanks, Dot.

168
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,501
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box...

69

00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,462
...if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

70
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,924
How's the rest of it?

‘Eh
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,093
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

 

72
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,970
The families are pretty reliable
with the pickups.

173
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,348
Nobody complaining
about wanting it all at once?

174
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,352
No, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

75
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,106
So I guess this is it for a while?

76
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,442
Don't worry about the families.

77
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,986
They'll keep getting their deliveries.

 

78
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,456
know times are tight,
but it's for the kids...

 

179
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,334
...and your sponsorship
would sure be appreciated.

 

 

180
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,380
Yeah, we have a silver level,
but the gold and platinum levels...

181
O01 5:22,.547 ==> 00s1.5: 27,385
...really get your name out there
on the banners and T-shirts.

182
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:32,974
Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call
me directly if things change, you hear?

183
00215734, 725 ==> 00315: 38,354
Gomey, take a brick to my head if I
ever have to make another Fun Run call.

184
00215: 38,521. => 00:15: 40,523
I'm done.
185
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,942
What's up? Why you smiling?

186
00%15:43,109 ==> 00:15: 45,153
Because the Ehrmantraut warrant
just came in.

187
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,281
Now we're talking. How quick
can you get your group together?

188
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,907
-Two, three hours.
-Make it two.

89
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,285
We're gonna nail that son of a bi--

90
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,169
Police! Search warrant!

91
00%17:31,050 ==> 00:17:32,802
Police! Search warrant!

92
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,972
Coming. Hold your horses.

93
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,393
Search warrant.

94
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,144
Police! Search warrant!

95
00217:42,.311 =-> 00:17:45,398
-Police. Search warrant.
-Police. Search warrant.

 

 

 

96

00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,067

How's that restraining order
working out for you?

197
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,071
If you want me to read that,
I'm gonna need my glasses.

198
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,871
Too bad you had to make the trip out
from headquarters, sergeant.

199
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,792
From out of bed, you mean. When a cop
kills himself, they want a full report.

200
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,045
Just to say hello to who's in charge
of the Record Bureau.

201
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,214
A single contact wound.

202
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,550
Powder burn on his temple
and right hand.

203
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,302
Suicide, I'll bet you.

204
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,512
-Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
=Yesi,

205
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,558
When I found him, he was....
He was dead.

206
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,234
Hey! Perfect timing.

207
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,612
Just about to get started.

208
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,658
You know, if you can get going
on that settling tank...
209
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,869
...that would be a huge help.

210
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,748
We left that stuff in there too long
after the last cook.

211
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,167
-Mr. White--

-I mean way too long.

21:2
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,586
Now we have a tremendous amount
of residue.

213
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,631
You know what we need to invest in
is a power washer.

214
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,302
Mr. White, can we just take a second
and talk about all this?

215
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,601
Yeah, yeah, sure.

216
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,144
Yeah.

 

217
00219210,566 ==—> 00219: 15,071
Look, you know what I think
we need to talk about?

218
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,406
Is doubling down.

219
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,325
Doubling down?

220
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,787
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

221
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,916
As in starting a new lab,
a lab that you'll run.

222
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,210
A cook all of your own.

223
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,254
Why not? You deserve it.

224
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,049
You're every bit as good as me.

225
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,260
Well, what do you think?

226
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:44,558
Mr. White, I think that
nothing has changed for me.

 

 

227
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,813
I just wanna get my money
and get out.

228
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,234
Jesse, this....

229
00919:355,903 =-> 00:19% 58,072
What we do...

230
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,662

...being the best at something...

231
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,288
...is a very rare thing.

232
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,375
You don't just toss
something like that away.
233
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,671
And what, you wanna squander
that potential?

234
00:20:13,838 =--> 00:20:16,716
Your potential? Why?

235
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,509
To do what?

236
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,346
-I don't know.
-Well, think.

237
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,558
To do what, Jesse?

238
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,730

I'll-- I'll figure it out, all right?

239
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,939
Look at you.

240
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,361

What have you got in your life, huh?

Nothing. Nobody.

241
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,321
Oh, wait. Yes.

242
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,824
-Video games and go-carts.
-Mr. W--

243
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,910
And when you get tired of that,
what then?

244
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,038
And how soon will you
start using again?
245
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,918
Look....

246
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:58,007
Look, I know how upset you are
about what happened to this boy.

247
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,676
I am just as upset as you are.

248
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,054
Are you? Really?

249
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,226
How can you say that to me? Jesus!

250
00821709,3893 => 003218 11,771
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

251
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,274
What, do I have to curl up ina ball
in tears in front of you?

 

 

252
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,111
Do I have to lock myself away in a room
and get high to prove it to you?

253

O0#212159,278 <> 003212 22,072
What happened to that boy

is a tragedy...

254
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,408
...and it tears me up inside!

255
002217324, 575 s=> 002218 28,287
But because it happened, what,

am I supposed to just lie down...

 

 

256
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,082
...and die with him? It's done!
257
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,918
It makes me sick that it happened...

258
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,921
..-jJust like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

259
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,297
What Todd did...

260
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,176
...you and I have done things
that are just as bad.

261
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,719
Yeah.

262
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:49,141
All the people that we've killed,
Gale and the rest.

263
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,770
If you believe that there's a hell,
I don't know if you're into that...

264
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,649
...but we're already pretty much
going there, right?

265
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,194
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

266
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,698
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

267
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,117
How many more people
are gonna die because of us?

268
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,537
No one. None.

269
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,289
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

270
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,001
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

271
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,295
-No.
-Always! You know what?

272
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,799
I'm done, okay?

273
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:27,847
You just give me my money,
and you and I, we're done.

274
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,478
Okay.

275
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,689
Why?

276
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,652
Why do you want this money?

277
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:46,198
Because it's mine. It's my cut.

278
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,742
But isn't it filthy blood money?

279
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,204
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

280
00#22252,370 =<“ 003222 55,124
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch
that dirty money.

281
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,626
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

282
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,504
Come on.

283
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,131
You want it.

284
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,800
You want it just as much as I want it.

285
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,138
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?

286
00223509,3805 ==> 00323:12,975
So stay and work with me...

287
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,394
-and you can make ten ti--
Twenty times as much.

288
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,735
Whatever, man.

289
00:23:23,736 =-> 00:23:27,114
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

290
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,160
-Yes, you do.
-It's on you, all right?

291
002234 32,620 =-> 003233 33,829.
-I'm done.
-No, you're not.

292
002233 33,996 => 00:23: 39,.1.68
You're not done. You're not leaving.
Because if you leave, you get nothing!
293
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,504
Do you understand me? Nothing!

294
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,174
Jesse!

295
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,055
Budget for the current fiscal year
for electronic surveillance...

296
00:23:51,221 =--> 00:23:55,601
.-is 1.5 million, on par with
ATF and the Marshal Service...

297
00223155, 768 => 00:23:58,062
-but still just a fraction of FBI totals.

298
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,648
We're lobbying Congress
for an additional 1.41...

299
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,484
...but we're waiting on action reports
to demonstrate...

300
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,780
...we're actually getting worthwhile
results. Our undercover operations...

301
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,448
..reap the most successful
actionable intelligence...

302
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,327
...if you refer to the chart
in Appendix 4.

303
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:17,414
If ASAC Schrader can tell us about
the surveillance man-hours....

304
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,958
Hank?

305
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,126
Hank?

306
00224 421,293 ==> 00224: 22,878
Hank!

307
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,423
I think we're going to wrap this up.

308
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,594
If ASAC Schrader can stay behind
while everyone else clears out.

309
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,930
Thank you, everybody.

310
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,319
You know no one wants...

311
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,822
...to see you succeed at this
more than me, right?

 

312
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,157
-Yes, sir.
-I know how good you are.

313
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,202
I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.

314
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,746
But you're not knocking down
doors anymore, bubba.

315
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:02,251
You're in charge of a district office,
and that comes with responsibilities.

316
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,714
I mean, Hank, basic reports
aren't being filed in a timely manner.

317
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,549
I'll work on it. It'll get better.

318
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,218
Yeah, it will, because way too much
time and money...

B19,
O0925:11,385 => 00:25:14,722
...is being spent on the Fring case,
a case which is essentially over.

320
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,267
All this overtime to surveil
Michael Ehrmantraut?

321
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,936
That's just money that could
be better spent elsewhere.

B22
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,189
I understand, but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

323
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,984
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street...

324
00225327,151, ==> 002253 31,030
...Fring's gang is still operational, and
Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.

325
00:25:31,280 =-> 00:25:32,573
I believe you. But so what?

326
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,492
It's one case out of dozens,
and you don't play favorites...

327
00:25:35,659 =-> 00:25:38,579
-...with it because it used to be yours.
-I really think--

328
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,373
Don't play favorites.
You got a bigger job than that.

329
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,625
I mean, forget the financial cost.

330
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,046
I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?

331
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,506
That was an error in judgment.
Won't happen again.

332
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,843
You're damn right it won't.
I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.

333
00225:53,.010 => 00:25:56,554
The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut
is now zero. We clear?

334
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,517
Sure. Thank you.

335
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,895
-Clear.
-Good.

336
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,813
We'll be in touch.

337
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,035
Yeah?

338

00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,746
-Hey.
-Hey.
339
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,378
So Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

340
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,006
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

341
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,633
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,344
No more following Ehrmantraut.

343
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,722
Not worth the financial investment.

344
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,974
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

345
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,560
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

346
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:48,440
He's just living a boring old-man life
like he has nothing left to hide.

347
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:52,152
-And none of Fring's crew is talking?
-Not giving an inch.

348
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,987
You sweeten the pot enough?

349
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,491
Zero jail time and an all-expense-paid
trip to Maui?

350
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,911
Not that, but close.
Nobody wants to bite.
351
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,454
Christ!

B52
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,416
They're either the most loyal crew in
history or someone's paying them off.

353
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,753
-You still checking bank records?
-No one living beyond their means.

354
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,423
Nine perps, all being represented
by one lawyer.

355
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,425
Not unusual in a case like this.

356
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,805
Yeah, this guy, what's his name?
Daniel Wachsberger?

357
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:26,061
He represents every one of these
douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.

358
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,063
Can we find out more
about the lawyer?

359
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,440
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

360
00227:30,607 ==> 00:27: 33,235
Like the shit ain't deep enough
for you already.

361
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,404
Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.
362
00227235,612 --> 00:27:37,655
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

363
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,242
Do it.

364
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,786
You're the boss.

365
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,231
All right. Shall we get started?

366
00228:11,398 --> 00328:15,527
Now, I know that most of this,
or all of this, is gonna be new to you.

367
00228:15,693 ==> 00:28:19,573
But did you take chemistry
in high school?

368
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,033
Just basic?

369
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,826
No.

370
00228322,993 => 00228: 25,037
Okay. That's all right.

3871
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:30,334
As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible
without being overwhelming.

372
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,045
Yes, sir.

373
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:40,219
Look, Todd, I don't need you
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

374
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,348
What I do need is your full effort
and attention.

375
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,767
Listen and apply yourself.

376
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:52,606
If you do that, then we just might have
a fighting chance here, okay?

377
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,486
-Okay.
-Okay.

378
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,405
Well, here we go.

379
00229713,669 ==> 00:29:17,756
Slowly. Steady.

380
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,190
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

381
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,489
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.

382
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,702
You're gonna like the little Schticky,
but you're gonna love the big Schticky.

383
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,371
For bigger messes like dust bunnies....

384
O08381¢11,828 s—> 003315 13,997
Now...

385
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,125
...the CO2 freezes the liquid...

386
00331:17,292 =-> 00:31:19,378
..-crystallizing it...

387
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,839
..which gives us our finished
methamphetamine.

388
002315245633 == 007313 28,303
Now all that's left...

389
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,182
..is to break it up, weigh it,
and we're done.

390
00:31:33,225 --> 00731:35,519
Wow, this is....

39.1,
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:42,859
This is complicated. It's gonna take me
a few more times to get a grasp on it.

392
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,738
Oh, yeah. It'll take a few more times.

393
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,202
I do all right?

394
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,039
You did fine, Todd.

395
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,209
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

 

 

396
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,422
Now all that's left,
I guess, is to talk money.

397
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,716
We can talk money
once I get this right.

398
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,439
Morning. Guess what I have.

399
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,318
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

400
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,573
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.

401
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,159
See? I put little faces on them.

402
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,599
Hey.

403
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,144
Hey.

404
00233¢15,535 --> 0033: 17,496
All right.

405
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,025
I'm working with a new guy now.

406
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,946
And I think that it....

407
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:55,825
I think it could possibly work out...

408
002332557992 --> 0033: 57,786
...because....

409
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,796
I'm trying, Hank. I really am.

I'm trying, but there's.... There's....
410
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,634
I mean,

it's like I don't even exist to her.

411
00234 412,801, ==> 0073.4: 15,929
Well, yeah. Yeah.

412
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,934
I mean, I know she's struggling.
I know, but I just don't know what to do.

413
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,103
I mean, what can I do?

414
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,313
Such a mess.

415
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,817
I mean, we-- Both of us...

416
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,487
-we just have screwed up so much.

417
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,032
I'm just....

418
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,911
I'm sorry. I don't--
Do you have any coffee?

 

419
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,247
-Maybe I can--
-Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.

420
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,000
-What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
-Yeah.

421
00235:20,.035 ==> 00:35:22,537
-All right. Here you go, buddy.
-Oh, thank you, Hank.

422
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,749
-Yeah.
-Look, I'm sorry to waste your time...

423
00235325,915 ==" 00735: 27,334
-...with all this.
-No.

424
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,587
-It's, you know-- But it's-- You know.
-Yeah.

425
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,968
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

426
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,679
Hey, could you excuse me?

427
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

428
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,267
-Tell me something good.
-You tell me.

429
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,437
Sweated the guy for 14 hours.
That should be some kind of record.

430
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,522
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?

431
00835 49,689 => 00:35: 52,859
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.

432
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,487
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?

433
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:02,243
What are you wasting your time for?
Throw a net around that son of a bitch.

434
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,371
All right.

435
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,944
-Yeah?
-Mike, hey, it's me.

436
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,696
-Can you talk?
=I Gar.

437
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,032
Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.

438
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,369
I don't wanna do this on the phone.
Are you available?

439
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,413
I can come by in a few hours.

440
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,748
That's not good for me.
Where are you now?

441
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

442
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,544
Where exactly?

443
00236:53,503 ==> 00:36:54,796
Palomita.

444
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,216
Oh, you know what? I'm not far.
I'll come to you. You just hang tight.

445
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,018
-Yeah?
-Mike, they're coming for you.

446
00237:05,185 <> 00:37: 11,563
-Right now. They're coming.
-Slow down, Walter. Who?

447
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,649
The DEA. The DEA--
Somebody flipped.

448
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,777
They have some kind of
bank surveillance.

449
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,446
And something about some lawyer.

450
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,283
Someone is talking, Mike,
and they're coming for you right now--

451
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,294
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

452
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,796
Dan Wachsberger.

453
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,174
He would've had better luck with
the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

 

454
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,093
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

455
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,889
All right, Saul, enough, please.
Instead of just sitting around here...

456
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,683
-...what can we do?
-Besides pray that he gets away...

457
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,477
...I'm open to ideas.
458
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,562
Because if the DEA
catches up with him...

459
00738:34,729 --> 00:38:37,857
...and he flips, it's good night,
John-boy.

460
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:43,112
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay?
No way.

461
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,449
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.

462
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,829
This is the second time the DEA
has confiscated his bankroll.

463
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,623
You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?

464
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,250
Look, he won't flip.

465
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,920
But his nine guys will.

466
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,147
Hey. It's him.

467
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,987
Mike, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

468
00%39724,153 ==> 0033.93 28,032
-The what?
-The.... Walt and Jesse are here.
469

00%39:3.28,199 => 003.39: 31,160
I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
I want you. I need your help.
470
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,247
-What do you need?
-I got a go-bag at the airport.

471
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,833
Passports, money,
but there are eyes everywhere.

472
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,501
I can't get close.

473
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:42,714
I need you to pick up that bag
and get it to me as soon as possible.

474
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,174
Do you know how thick
the crap storm is out there?

475
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,427
Told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

476
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,347
-Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
-Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?

477
00239351, 514 => 00:39: 55,018
-Just tell me what to do.
-No, kid. Not you.

478
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,353
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

479
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,440
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you...

480
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:04,402
...So they're probably sitting on my car
right now, hoping I do something stupid.
481
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,155
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

482
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,115
-No, Jesse.
-Jesus, I'll do it.

483
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,783
Besides, you're out, remember?

484
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,162
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.

485
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,779
Hello, Walter.

486
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:35,410
Before I hand this over,
I need something from you.

487
00241:35,576 => 003412 39,205
-And what's that?
-The names of your nine men.

488
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,335
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

489
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,547
The point is, Mike, it affects me.

490
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,384
t affects Jesse too.
And we deserve to know.

491
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,513
The only thing left to do now
is leave town. You understand?

 

 

492
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,724
"Leave town."

493
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,811
Yeah, I just can't up and leave
like you, Mike.

494
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,231
I've got a family,
I've got people who depend on me.

495
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,066
Yeah.

496
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,459
Goodbye, Walter.

497
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
You're welcome!

498
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,511
I'm sorry, what?

499
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,847
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

500
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,474
I don't owe you a damn thing.

501
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,811
All of this, falling apart like this,
is on you.

502
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,401
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

503
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,362
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA...

504
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,948
...and now suddenly,
this is all my fault?

505
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,868
-Why don't you walk me through this?
-We had a good thing...

506
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,997
..-you stupid son of a bitch!
We had Fring. We had a lab.

507
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,000
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

508
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,294
-Oh, my God.
-You could've shut your mouth...

509
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,880
...cooked, and made as much money
as you ever needed.

510
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,300
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

511
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,553
You and your pride and your ego!

512
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,555
You just had to be the man.

 

513
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,100
If you'd done your job,
known your place...

514
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,727
..we'd all be fine right now.

515
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,947
TI just... os
516
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,326
I just realized that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

517
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,416
I'm sorry, Mike.

518
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,296
This.... This whole thing
could've been avoided.

5.19
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,590
Shut the fuck up...

520
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,221
...and let me die in peace.

af
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,470
Mr. White?

2
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,472
Hello?

3
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:21,123
Mr. White,
the car's been dealt with, sir.

4
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,794
No one tailed you?

5
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,881
No, I stayed off the main streets
and kept checking, so....

6
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,428
Joe ask any questions?

7
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:39,349
I told him RV job, just like you said,
and he totally knew.

8
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:51,486
It's pretty cool the way they do that.
They just turn a car into a cube.

9
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,588
So should we deal
with this other thing now?

10
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,223
Yeah.

11
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,894
Sure.

12
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,287
-I don't want to talk about this.
-Okay.
3
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,748
It had to be done.

4
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,167
Okay.

5
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,088
All right.

6
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,066
I need to talk to you.

7
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,693
In private.

8
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,952
So, what's the story?

 

9
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,870
You get to Mike?

20
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,623
He get out safe?

21
00:03:27,582 -->. 00;03% 29,251
He's gone.

22
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,045
All right.

23
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,716
Well, what about
those nine guys in jail?

24
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,635
I mean, they got no reason
not to talk now.

25
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,429
So, what do we do?
26
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,640
"We"? Who's "we"?

27
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,310
There is no "we," Jesse.

28
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,688
I'm the only vote left...

29
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,815
...and I'll handle it.

30
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,760
My client will supply information
relating to the organization...

31
0005<01,927 ==> 00305: 05,722
..-distribution and production of Fring's
methamphetamine enterprise.

32
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,476
We expect all charges to be dropped,
and Dennis not only walks out of here...

33
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,978
...a free man,
but also receives blanket immunity.

34
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,734
For what he'll be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

35
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,492
Best I'd be willing to do
is queen for a day and reduced charges.

36
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,701
All charges dropped.

37
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,163
Queen for a day and a five-k.
That's the best you're gonna get.
38
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,290
No way. Guys, come on.

39
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,501
You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

40
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,044
Where you going?

41
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,548
Shopping for someone who can tell me
something I don't already know.

42
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
Hey, hey.

43
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,219
I got plenty you don't know.

44
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,222
You seem a little confused.

45
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,932
This here is a buyer's market.

46
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,228
I got eight other assholes just like you,
four of them within 100 feet from here.

47
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,773
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll give me
the money and Ehrmantraut.

48
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,943
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

49
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,529
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.
50
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,491
-So?
-Maybe you should order something.

51
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,745
-Do you want a coffee or something?
-Not just now.

52
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,124
I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

53
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,544
I think this will play just fine,
and I'm not thirsty.

54
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,005
So let's take a look at the list.

55
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,426
Lydia, you've come all this way.
You do have the list?

56
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,721
-Yes, I have it.
-Good.

57
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,765
It's just not written down.

58
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,644
-And why is that?
-It's in my head. Safer there.

59
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,103
I see.

60
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,814
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

61
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,149
Not just yet.
62
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,155
It was my understanding
that attending to these nine names...

63
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,157
...was precisely what you wanted.

64
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,743
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

65
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,162
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.

66
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:40,293
So, what, am I not tying up loose ends
for our mutual benefit?

67
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,296
You're tying up loose ends,
and I don't wanna be one of them.

68
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,674
I give you that list,
I've served my purpose.

69
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,343
Then maybe I'm just one more person
who knows too much.

70
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,848
So you put that list in my hands,
and in your mind...

71
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,645
...1 immediately just murder you,
just right here in this restaurant?

72
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,399
-No. Not right here. Of course.
-Here in this public place, immediately?
73
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,025
-That is not--
-Listen, Lydia.

74
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,863
You made me promise on my children's
lives that I guaranteed your safety.

75
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,573
From Mike.

76
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,243
You guaranteed
I'd be safe from Mike.

77
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,748
There's no way he'd ever go for this,
you getting rid of his guys.

78
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,503
You wouldn't be doing this, the names,
if Mike were still a factor.

79
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,969
Yeah. That's what I thought.

80
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,641
What do you want, exactly?

81
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,811
Because if you don't want
to give me that list...

82
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,814
...then I've truly got no use for you.

83
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,361
I can grow your business
exponentially.

84
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,696
Just give me the list.
85
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,824
I can do that by helping you
expand into a larger...

86
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,578
-highly active, highly profitable
marketplace.

87
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,748
What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

88
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,208
The Czech Republic?

89
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,962
Did you know there's a higher demand
for meth there than anywhere in Europe?

90
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,214
Five percent of its 10 million people...

al
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,884
.-which is roughly the population
of the Southwest...

92
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,679
...from western Texas to Phoenix,
are using meth.

93
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,016
You keep your market here,
but by adding overseas sales...

94
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,435
...you can more than double
your current profits.

95
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,481
And I checked. The average purity
is only about 60 percent.
96
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,942
They've never seen
anything like your product.

97
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,737
You'll blow their hair back.

98
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,743
Shipping internationally
seems like courting disaster.

99
00209:36,910 ==> 00:09: 37,952
Not if you're Madrigal.

100
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,039
Madrigal is under investigation
by the DEA.

101
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,041
The restaurant division, mostly.

102
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,545
We've got 46,000 employees
spread across 14 divisions.

103
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:52,342
And once Mike's people are no longer
a factor, things should tidy up nicely.

104
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,302
This is what I do, you understand?

105
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,846
Move things from point A to point B
all over the globe.

106
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,390
One-point-two million
metric tons a month...

107
00209:59,557 => 00:10: 04, 562
...and all of it right at my fingertips,
a laptop click away.

108
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,899
The Czech Republic....

109
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,194
-Who's on the other end?
-People I ship to regularly.

110
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,447
People I've worked with for years.
Professional and very amenable.

111
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,242
I'm very careful who I work with.

LL2
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:28,586
And if this is such a slam dunk,
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

3
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,590
I did. He said yes. We were
in the final stages of working it out...

4
002103 32,757 ==" 002103 34,217
...when somebody killed him.

5
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,685
You don't think Gus Fring built
his distribution network all by himself.

 

 

6
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,482
There are considerable advantages
to diversification of distribution...

117
00%10749,983 ==> 00:10: 53,903
..-like putting 6000 miles
between you and your product.

118
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,785
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating
you'll gross about 2 million.
1 9)

-All right.

-Now, with Fring...

121
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,050
..my end was gonna be 30 percent,
which I believe is more than fair.

122.
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,386
-Okay.
-Trust me, if you do this--

23
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,890
Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.

24
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,643
Now, first things first.

25
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,554
Shake on it?

 

26
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,019
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

 

 

27

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,403
Todd, I think it's time

I meet your uncle.

28
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,739
No iron pile.

 

29
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,617
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit. Too many eyes.

 

130
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,038
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.
131
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,748
Well, gonna keep it simple.

I say we go with a riot.
Our boys get it done in a riot.

136
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,136
No, no, no. No chaos.

137
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:10,808
I don't want the goon squad rolling in
and stealing our shot, you know?

138
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,644
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

13.9
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,064
Just boom, boom, boom.

140
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,191
-You know what I'm saying?

-Yeah.

00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,072
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.

We

144
00:14:28,284 --> 00:

4:28,117

So how many guys we got at MDC?

4:32,789

Three, counting Shattuck.
And he makes the schedule now...

145
00:14:32,955 --> 00:

 

4:35,958

...SO we can put who we need
where we need them.

146

00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,045

All right. So MDC's

covered.

What about the rest?

147
00:14:39,212 --> 00:

4:41,047

need G block in Valencia, right?

148
00:14:42,340 --> 00:

Our guy's on the night shift.

149
00:14:44,008 --> 00:

His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

5.1,

00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,181

Have him switch with somebody.

Just get it done.

152

00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,518
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

153

00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,478
Might have to hire out.

154

Mix blood with chuntaros?

-No.

There's no need. We got enough.

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,410
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that
short walking window after lunch.

158
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,579
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.

Real tight.

I gotta be straight with you, man.
Taking out all these guys is doable.

161
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
But hitting them in three separate jails
all within two minutes?

162
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,433
I mean, whacking bin Laden
wasn't this complicated.

I've seen this one before.

165
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,777
I wonder...

166
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,990

It can be done exactly how I want

170

00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,820
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

71
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,539
Figure it out.

Excuse me a second.
Couple more photos.

181
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,595
Yes?

182
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,347
It's done.

183
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,233
New details have emerged
in the spate of jail deaths...

184
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,860
...that rocked central New Mexico
three days ago.

185
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,114
As of yet, no names of victims
have been released...

186
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,742
...-but authorities continue to investigate
what appears to be...

187
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,495
...a carefully coordinated
sequence of attacks...

188
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:09,125
...that occurred within minutes in
three different correctional, facilities. ...

189
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,210
-Is it okay if I turn this off?
-Oh, sure.

190
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,295
I don't want the news on right now.

191
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,716
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

192
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,010
-Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.
-Okay.

193:
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,430
Hi, honey.

194
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,600
Dinner will be in about an hour.

195
00820327, 727 ==> 003208 81,105
And I thought we could have
that chicken you like.

196
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,984
-Or we could order Chinese.
-Sure.

197
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,902
Here we go.

198
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,824
That fun? Play with your toys?

199
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,161
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?
See you in a little bit.

200
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,621
Hey, Hank.

I was just getting ready to leave.
201
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,248
Something to drink?

202
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

-Rocks, yes.

00:22:11,038 =-> 00:22:12,623
Oh, yeah?

208
--> 00:22:17,336
I'd spend my days...

00:22:14,750
Back in college,

209
00222:19,338 ==> 00:22:21,966
..-Marking trees in the woods
with this....

00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,430

Marking

2

trees?

2

00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,349

Yeah. Crews would

 

2
0022: 31,517
...and find the

come in later...

3

--> 00:22:34,478

trees I tagged

and cut them down.

214
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:44,321

First, you go in and you mark locations
for skid trails and landings.

215
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:49,201
Then you choose specific trees
all within a selected grid.

2

00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,748

day...

...-hike in...

9

00%23:00,212 ==> 00:23:02,256
...pick up where I left off.

220
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,096

Oh,

it sounds nice...

221
00223:09,263 => 00:23:11,473
..being out in the woods all day.

229
00:23:12,099 --> 00723:13,851
No, it wasn't so great.
223

00:23:14,018 -->

00:23:16,729

I got sunburned.

There were

mosquitoes.

224
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,690

just wanted to

make a few bucks.

Buy beer.

225
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,863

Been thinking

about that job

more and more lately.

226
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,909
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
227
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,038
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

228
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,221
I used to love to go camping.

229
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,329
-This way.
-Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.

230
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,415
There you go, sweetie. That's it.

231
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,625
Oh, my God! Look at her go!

232
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,421
-Good job! Good job!
-Over here. Peekaboo. This way.

233
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,672
Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

234
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,843
Where'd you go?
I can't see you. Where'd you go?

235
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,053
There you are!

236
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,224
You're really good with her.

237
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,683
Come here, my baby girl.

238
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,729
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.
239
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,815
Mama's gonna get her exercise.

240
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,030
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?

241
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,158
Hey, Louis.

242
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,203
One moment.

243
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,081
Nothing. What's up?

244
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
Oh, well.

245
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,847
It's so nice to see you smile again.

246
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,434
I mean, you seem good.

247
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,687
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.

248
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,650
To see you laugh like that just now....

249
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,946
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

250
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,408
I don't-- I don't really....

251
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,333
We've been thinking...

252.
00229311,500 ==> 00:29:14,795
...Hank and I, that it may be time...

253
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,756
...to take the kids home.

254
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,012
It's been almost three months, right?

255
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,931
Almost three?

256
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,562
Does Hank not want--?

257
002293 32,729 ==> 00329: 35,315
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.

258
005292 35,482 --> 00329: 38,277
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

25.9
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,821
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

260
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,572
And we're always here for you...

261
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,118
...and wanna help you
any way that we can.

262
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,412
But...

263
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,709
We're starting to worry...

264
00229: 53,.917 ==> 00:29:56,586
...that maybe....
265
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,633
Maybe we're enabling you.

266
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,432
Sweetie, you've had
a lot on your plate...

267
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,644
...and you and Walt have had a lot--

268
002302 12,811 —-—> 00:302 16, 732
So much to contend with.

269
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,943
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy.
You know that, right?

270
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,654
It can be so helpful,
such a good tool.

271
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,825
And I'm very, very proud of you...

272
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,618
sasbut I--

273
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,704
We....

274
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,417
Maybe at this point...

275
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:40,005
...the best way to help
repair the family...

276
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:45,469
...-would be to repair the family,
you know?

277
002315 53,620 == 007313 55,831
Take a drive with me.

278
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,811
Here. I'll get it.

279
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,568
Walt.

280
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,799
This is: it.

281
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,012
This is what you've been working for.

282
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:59,102
I rented this place and I started
bringing it here because...

283
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,355
-I didn't know what else to do.

284
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,650
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

285
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,362
It was just so much, so fast.

286
002334 09,529 s=> 002333 11,656
I tried weighing it.

287
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:16,620
I figured one bill of any denomination
weighs a gram.

288
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,874
There are 454 grams
to a pound, but....

289
00233223,335 --> 00:33:29,508
There's a variety
of denominations, so....

290
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,220
How much is this?

29.1,
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,724
I have no earthly idea.

292
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,102
I truly don't.

293
00:33:42,062 =-> 00:33:43,855
I just stack it up...

294
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,526
-keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.

295
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,447
There is more money here...

296
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,617
...than we could spend
in 10 lifetimes.

297
00:33:55,784 --> 00:34:00,914
I certainly can't launder it,
not with a hundred car washes.

298
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,419
Walt...

299
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,258
...I want my kids back.

300
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:17,013
I want my life back.

301
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,516
Please tell me.

302
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,978
How much is enough?

303
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,315
How big does this pile have to be?

304
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,102
Shit!

305
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,719
Hi.

306
00:36:20,095 =-> 00:36:21,513
Hey.

307
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,018
I hope I'm not disturbing you
or anything.

308
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,603
I tried calling, but--

309
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,023
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.

310
00236% 32,315 --> 00:36:34,150
And you didn't answer
your home line.

311
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,236
It's disconnected.

312
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,363
Well, unplugged.

 

313
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,825
I mean, did you leave
a message, or...?

314
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,452
No.

315
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,999
So, what's up?

316
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,673
No, I was just in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

317
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,264
You wanna come in, or...?
318

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,560
Sure. Thanks.

319
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,034
You know, I'd offer you
a beer or something...

320
00237:25,201 ==> 003373 29,914
-...but, you know, I'm out.
-No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.

321
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,501
You didn't wind up moving, I see.

322
00237 433,668 ==> 00737: 35,587
Didn't have to.

323
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,298
Saul told me what you did.

324
002374 41,551, ==> 00737: 45,597
Anyways, I'm not in jail.

325
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,225
You aren't either, so there you go.

326
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,481
There was no other option, Jesse.
It had to be done.

327
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,196
I'm not coming back.
328
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,073
I know.

32.9
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:09,329
So why are you here, exactly?

330
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,589
It's funny, I....

33.1
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,425
I saw a Bounder the other day.

332
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,344
-Bounder?
-Yeah.

333
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,305
Our RV? A Bounder?

334
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,727
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

335
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,980
Yeah. Well, I mean,
within a couple of years, I guess.

336
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,482
Early '80s.

337
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,027
It was certainly in a lot better shape
than our old hunk of junk.

338
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,488
Much nicer paint job.

339
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,242
No bullet holes in the door.

340
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,620
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

341
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,165
Yeah. It was primitive.

342
002383 54,332 ==> 00738 58,962
You know, whenever
I hit a red light, I used to pray...

343
00238:59,128 ==> 00:39:01,339
..it wouldn't crap out on me.

344
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,007
Yeah.

345
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,636
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that....

346
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,264
That screeching sound
just out of the blue...

347
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,890
...like we hit a pack of cats.

348
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,435
Power-steering belt.
That's what that was.

349
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,563
You know, I always had this....

350
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,648
This whole system.

351
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,150
Strategy to not let it idle too low.

352
O0#39221,38L7 => 00:39: 24,i612
Remember that time we ran out of gas
coming back from a cook?

353
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,656
The gauge. It always said half-full.

354
00:39:26,823 =-> 00:39:31,035
You walked three miles with a jerrican

while I waited on the side of the road...

355
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,539
...praying the whole time
that no cop would show up...

356
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,291
...no Good Samaritan.

357
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,209
God.

358
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,336
We had money.

S59
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,213
Why'd we keep it?

360
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,466
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

361
00239745,633 ==> 00339: 47,552
Inertia?

362
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,387
Yeah.

363
00239:49,554 ==> 00:39:51,055
Yeah.

364
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,891

Inertia.

365
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,366
So, hey, you know, I gotta get going.

366
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,910
-Me too.
-I'm meeting friends.

367
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,370
I gotta get going as well.

368
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,629
I left something for you.

369
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,225
Hey.

370
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,781
I'm out.

371
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,457
I'm out.

372
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,424
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

373
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,010
-Perhaps some big hoops.
-I do indeed.

374
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,846
I feel like I want to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

375
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,349
-I don't know, like colors--
-I don't know. Coins.

376
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,518
Did you have a coin collection?
Did you?

377
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,270
I've heard it's very therapeutic.

378
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,649
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

379
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,110
You can play around with it,
take them in and out.

380
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,070
Not enough hours in the day, right?

381
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,906
-There's not enough hours.
-My hairstylist told me...

382
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,242
...to take prenatal vitamins.

383
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,868
For your hair?

384
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,246
He said they work,
so I figured why not?

385
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,208
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

386
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,960
Yeah. Is it over there?

387
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,753
-Yeah, it's right here.
-Okay.

388
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,549
-Especially for a home brew, though.
-Paba-free. That's good.
389
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,426
-I don't know why it would be bad.
-Yeah. Me neither.

390
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,680
Oh, do you--? I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

391
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,056
You remember that?

392
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,976
You wanted to be
a beach bum so badly.

393
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,644
I did.

394
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,813
You and your stiff hair.

395)
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,775
-Stiff? Whose stiffy? What?
-Hey, hey.

396
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,570
I was interested
to see you get into that.

397
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,656
-It's like chemistry.
-Borage oil is supposed to be good.

398
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,825
-Better than flaxseed?
-I don't know.

399
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:25,121
-That's cool. I like your style.
-There is no Christmas.

400
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,374
-Maybe I should brew up a batch.
-Schraderbrau?

401
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,709
-Yeah.
-I vote yes.

402
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,587
-I second that.
-Well, there you go. It's unanimous.

403
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,632
Well, who am I to fly in the face
of public demand, right?

404
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,846
All right.

405
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,100
Anybody want anything?
You want anything?

406
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,687
-No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.
-Yeah? All right.

407
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,814
Does it look glossier?

408
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,858
Do I have a halo?

409
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,068
-How's she doing?
-She's good.

410
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,447

Yeah? Try not to put any
of the sunscreen on her fingers.

411
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:08,349

2
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,618
Hello, Carol.

3
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,569
-She's so cute.
-I know, isn't she?

4
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,197
She takes after her mother.

5
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,205
Well, thank goodness for that.

6
00204: 59,216 =-> 00:05:02,093
Okay, everybody,
since you were so good...

7
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,349
...and you ate all your dinner,
everybody.

8
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:13,355
Is sweetie hungry? Sweetie, pumpkin pie,
this one's for you. That one's for you.

9
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,559
She's got a lot more hair than you do.

10
00205: 52,7435 =-> 00:05:55, 981
Yes. You wear that so well. You do.

AL.
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,073
-Look at what I have. Special one for you.
-Oh, my God...

12
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,075
..-Skyler. I'll take the pink one.

00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,493
It's a pink one.

14
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,871
-Skyler.
-I know, right?

15.
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,499

Well, actually, they were my idea.

You are all welcome.

16
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,127
-You are the devil.
-Oh, my gosh.

17
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,839

Hey, buddy. Ready for a cold one?

18
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,465
No, no.

19
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,094
-Not feeling 100 percent.

20
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,971
No, no. I just--

21
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,140
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

22
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,933
Yeah.

23
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,936
No, I'm good, I--
I think we need to shove off.

24
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,230
-Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

25

I hope it's not something you ate.

00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,940
Sorry, Skyler, I hate to leave--

26
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:43,361
-No, no. Don't worry about it. I have help.
-And by that, she means me.

27
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,072
-That is correct.
-Holly can help.

28
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,575
-Let's go send them on their way.
-Yeah.

29
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,828
-Let's say goodbye to auntie and uncle.
-Been too long.

30
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,456
-Say, "Bye, auntie."
-Bye, sweetie, bye-bye.

31
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,709
You know, it's been about 100 years
since we've been bowling.

32
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,545
-Then how about Thursday night?
-Oh, that sounds great.

33
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,380
Thank you for having us.

"Bye, Uncle Hank. Bye, Aunt Marie."

00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,069

Oh, hi, Walt.

Europe.

46
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,458
I can't believe it.
Were you there when she said that?

And, you know, where they were
three or four months ago.

53
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56, 643
She was talking about it
like it was a second honeymoon.

54
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,521
-We need to go to Europe. We could go.
-Yeah.

55
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,148
Have it be like a business trip,
you know?

56
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,570
It could be Italy. To Lake Como....

Oh, God, sweetie.

-All you have to do is show up.
-For what?

70
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,539
Three hours in the emergency room,
all for nothing.

EL
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01, 666
All they did was rule out a heart attack.

72
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,127

Marie, baby. I'm okay. I'm fine, trust me.
Discussion over.

75
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,929
-And do not tell Skyler.
-What? Why?
76
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,598
Just don't.
77
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,768

 

There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

At 30 cents wholesale? Yeah.

86
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,567
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display.

87
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,902
Separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

 

88
002102 53,069 => 00:10: 57,615
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

89
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,493
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

90
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,832
So maybe we move that over to the cash
register, by the 5-hour Energy drink.

91
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,710
-Sure. That'd be fine.

Dude, you are tripping. I'm not dead.

I'm on the starship Enterprise,
macking on Yeoman Rand...

Down to your molecules and bones.
They're making a copy.

172
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:45,082
That dude who comes out on the other
side? He's not you. He's a color Xerox.

173
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49, 629
So you're telling me every time Kirk went
into the transporter he was killing himself?

174
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,341
So over the whole series,
there's, like, 147 Kirks?

175
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:59, 347
At least. Dude, why do you think
McCoy never likes to beam nowhere?

Look it up. It's science.

-Star Trek script?

-Yeah. gotta write it down, is all.

Neutral zone is quiet.

The crew is bored,
so they put on a pie-eating contest.

182
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,000
The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies.

-Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.

...as fast as the replicator
can churn them out:

187
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:46,143
Finally it's down to just three:
Kirk, Spock and Chekov.

188
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,729
Okay, Spock always wins these things.

189
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,066
How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo?
Spock's like a toothbrush.

190
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,943
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

191
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,656
Spock has total Vulcan control over his
digestion. You wanna hear this or not?

...he can't take it anymore. He yorks.

194
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,498
Now it's just down
to Chekov and Spock.

195
002203 07,665 ==> 002203 13,295
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole
fat stack of quatloos riding on this...

00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,215
...and he has figured out a way to win.

197
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,428
He's got Scotty back in the Transporter
Room locked in on Chekov's stomach.

198

Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

-Where's he sending them? The toilet?
-Space.

200
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:31,522
There's blueberries just floating out there,
frozen, because it's in space.

201
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,358
And Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth...

202
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,028
..-and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

Meanwhile,
Scotty's in the Transporter Room...

204
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,993
...fiddling with levers
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in.

205
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,956

Scotty beamed his guts into space.

No way.

You're missing the best part.

00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,644

Woody Harrelson, live and in person.

Pull up a bong and take a seat.

219
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,022

Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.

Don't be doing that.

220
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,442
Sorry to keep you on ice out there,
If I'd known it was you....

221
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,361
Well, that Francesca,
I've warned her before.

222
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,782
One more time
and it's back to the DMV.

223
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:51,287
So are we on our own today?

224
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,205
Barn door open.

225
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,332
Barn door?

226

00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,299
I haven't seen him.

228
00223303, 799 => 00:23:05,885
Just as well, probably.

229
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,721
That whole thing in the jails.
I mean...

230
00223208,929 ==> 00:23:12,016
...when they start to whack lawyers,
that's when I draw the line.

231
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,811
This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

232
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:21,525
...and that goes to
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp...

It's up in White Horse.

Drew Sharp's parents.

237
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,002
Drew Sharp? That's the kid on TV?

Scratch that. I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

240
002232 48,135 “> 00:23: 51,555
The thing is, what those folks want
is to know what happened to their boy.

241
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,851
A sack full of cash on their doorstep?
That's just gonna raise more questions.

242
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,313
Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
That's Mike's granddaughter?

243
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,192
-So this is Mike's money?
-It's mine.

244
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,572
It's your money. Okay. And you're
giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...?

245
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,616
It's what Mike wanted.

246
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,789
So you and Mike,
you've been in touch?

247
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,838
So we're just talking about charity?

248
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,674
Yeah.

249
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:32,137
Okay, look, you know, shelling out
money to the ex and her little boy...

...I kind of get it. I mean, kind of.
But this, this is a bridge too far.

251
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:42,314
I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still
gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.

252

Brass tacks.
Okay, my job is to advise...

253
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,116
...and my advice is, come on, already.

254
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,576
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue.

255
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,912
You better believe
his family's on the radar.

256
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,915
A couple million bucks shows up,
they're gonna snatch it.

257
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,418
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

258
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,963
-What, are you going for a hat trick?
-I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.

259
00225:06,130 --> 00:25:08,132
No, no, no! I was just thinking out loud.

260
002253 08,298 ==> 00325: 11,093
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

cleaning up a little, getting some rest.

What you asked Saul to do.
I mean, come on.

00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,069
Do you have any explanation at all?

-What?

It's like you said.

284
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,539
It's blood money.

it was in the heat of the moment.

290

This is your money.

Come on, you've earned it.

292

Drew Sharp.

293
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,134
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

The past is the past.

Look, nothing can change
what we've done.

301
00229:13,335 => 00:29:16,213
That's right. I'm done.

302
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,926
I've been out for about a month.

303
00:229:23,679 --> 00:29:29,810
But there is nothing left
for us to do except to try...

304
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,728
...to live...

Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

307
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,506
She needs someone looking after her.

308
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:06,722
Mike is perfectly capable
of looking after his own granddaughter.

309
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,225
don't think so.

310
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,021
I don't think he is capable.

314.
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,773
I don't think he's coming back.

312

...offing Mike's guys?

315
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:33,415
If he was out there, you'd have to look
over your shoulder for the rest of your life.

3.16
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:38,503
And that's not how you do things.
So I think he's dead...

317
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,256
-and I think you know that.

318
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,552
I don't know that.

319
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,724
I don't.

I did not kill Mike.

822

The last time that I saw him, he had
his bag, the one that I brought him.

B23:
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,782
And he got into his car,
and he drove away.

324
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,993

Mike is fine, wherever he is.

We both know
that he can take care of himself.

 

 

336

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05, 632

can I get a late curfew?

00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,720
Have you seen Leaves of Grass?

361
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,307
My book.

364
00#35213,987 => 00:35: 16,281
You don't think Junior...?

365
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,450
You're kidding, right?

366
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,161
Well...

...it'll show up.

368
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,973
What's wrong with Hank?

369
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,187
It's a stomach bug, sounds like.

370
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,773
He hasn't been to work all week.

371
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,654
Well, good night.

372
00235157,405 => 00:35:58,740
Night.

373
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,246
Mister. Can you help me out?

374
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,248
Spare some change?

375
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,011

Yeah.

384
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,124
Anything you want us
to tell Steve Gomez?

385
00239:36,291 ==> 00:39:37,876
Says he's worried about you.

386
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,962
Yeah. Tell him I already
got two grandmas.

387
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,759
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

388
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,347
-Guess we better hit it.
-Yeah.

389
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,558
Yeah.

390
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,662
-Hey, guys.
-Walt.

391
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,205
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

392
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,790
How you doing?

393
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,918
Well, you know, I can't complain.

394
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,462
How's your son's arm?
I was thinking about that.

395
00240222,629 => 00240226,132
-Back to 100 percent. Going to district.
-Gonna be exciting. This Saturday?

396
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29, 636
This Saturday morning.
I think first pitch is at 10 a.m.

397
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32, 639
-Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun.
-Should be a big crowd.

398
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,475
Guys, you're still on the clock here.
Let's go.

399
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:39,062
-See you, Walt.
-See you, Artie. All right, Scott. Be well.

-Yeah.
-Have you--?

404
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,165
Did you get to see a doctor? I mean...

405
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01, 960
...when one of these things
lasts more than three days...

406
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,589
-...you really should get that checked.
-Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine...

407
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,925
...I'm, what they say,
on the upswing, you know?

408
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,177
-Good. Good to hear.
-Yeah.

409
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,766
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I-- Well....

410
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,561

coming to you.

You know.

413
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,155
How's--?
How's things at the car wash?

Yeah, really good.

Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

 

417

-Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick...

418

...-SO I probably
shouldn't worry about it.

419
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,388
Well, Skyler will be very happy
to hear that you're feeling better.

420
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,142
Which reminds me,
I better get back to it.

421
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,188
If there's anything I can do....

422
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,447

»..you're gonna laugh,
but I have to ask you about this.

425
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,889
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

426
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:42,685
I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker
that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it?

427
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,397
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us.

428
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,235
You wouldn't know anything about this,
would you, Hank?

429
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,045
You okay?

430
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,133
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

431
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,565
It was you.

432
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,984
All along, it was you!

433
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,862
You son of a bitch.

434
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,406
You drove into traffic

to keep me from that laundry.

435
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,117
Calm down.

436
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,578
That call I got, telling me Marie
was in the hospital...

437
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,705
...that wasn't Pinkman.

438
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,583
You had my cell number.

439
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50, 962
You killed 10 witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

440

00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,840
-Listen to me.

-You bombed a nursing home.

441
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,469
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.

 

442
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00, 930
You lying, two-faced sack of shit.

443
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,557
Hank.

444
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,768
Look, I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

445
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,812
I swear to Christ...

446
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,524
-...I will put you under the jail.
-Take a breath, okay? Listen to yourself.

These wild accusations, they could
destroy our family. And for what?

448
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,405
You don't give a shit about family!

449
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,831
Hank, my cancer is back.

450
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,875
Good.

452

I'm sorry you feel that way.

I wanna beat this thing, I do.

454
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42, 638
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

455
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:50,771
But the truth is, in six months,
you won't have someone to prosecute.

456
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,358
But even--

457
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:59, 906
Even if somehow you were
able to convince anyone...

458
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,910
...that I was capable
of doing these things...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

459
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,124
...-you and I both know I would
never see the inside of a jail cell.

460
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16, 631
I'm a dying man...

461
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,841
..who runs a car wash.

462
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:23,763
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

463
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,061
What's the point?

464
00:45:35,233 =-> 00:45:37,652
Have Skyler bring the kids here.

465
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40, 488
And then we'll talk.

466
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,203
That is not going to happen.

467
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,336
I don't know who you are.

468
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,424
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

469
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,264
If that's true...

470
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,102
...-if you don't know who I am...

471
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,317
...then maybe your best course...

Mariano, it's me.
I need you to get Skyler on the line.

2
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,102
No, no, I need you to get her
on the phone right now.

3
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,479
Tell her it's urgent.

4

I am giving you permission, Mariano.
You make her get off the phone.

00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,416
Mariano, who is Skyler
on the phone with?

7
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04, 429
Yeah.

8
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09, 935
Okay.

9
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,579
-Where is she? Where's Skyler?
-She just kind of left.

10
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,040
She didn't say where she was going.

11
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,847
Skyler, my-- My head is spinning.

12
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,392
And yours, I....

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
13
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,979
I can't even imagine.

14
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,443
So much makes sense to me now.

15
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,615
You jumping in the pool,
you sending us your kids, I get it.

6
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,453
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.

7
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56, 333
He's a monster.

 

8

00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,252
He's a.
9

00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,216
Look, I don't know what he did to you
to force you to keep his secrets.

20
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,804
If he threatened you,
or whatever mind games he played....

21
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,849
I don't know if there was abuse.

22
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,269
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

23
00207: 17,520 => 00:07219,481
Don't hold anything back, okay?

24
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,443
I mean, I don't even understand if you
know the full extent of this...

25

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00207 423,610 ==> 00207: 24,903
..what he's done.

26
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,491
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

27
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,914
But, look, that's all behind you,
starting now.

28
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,042
You're done being his victim.

29
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,212
Because here's what we're gonna do.

30
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,131
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.

31
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,469
You and the kids will move back
to our house...

32
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,806
...where you'll be safe,
where he can't get to you.

33
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,561
Hank, does Marie...?

34
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,649
No. We'll get to that soon enough.

35
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,776
It's just you and me right now, okay?

36
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,155
Okay.

37
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,865
Before Wei...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

38
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,537
Before we get you back
to the house, I....

39
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,417
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

40
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,210
Take as long as you like.

41
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:27,424
Just start from the beginning when you
first became aware of Walt's activities...

42
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,303
...and just try to be
as detailed as you can.

43
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,726
What, right-- Right here?

44
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,729
-Right now?
-Sure. Why not?

And just remember to state your name
and the date before you start.

47
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,447
Hank, do...?

48
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,160
Do we have to do this right now?

49
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00, 832
No, we don't have to do this

right now, no.

50
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:06,254
Here's the thing, I need something solid
that I can bring to my people.

51
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,506
A statement, on the record.

52
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,176
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity...

53
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,887
...-whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

54
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,639
Okay? I mean, you see,
building a case this big...

55
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,559
..-gathering evidence,
enough to get a conviction...

56
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,895
...we're talking a long-haul proposition.

57
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,940
I don't want that bastard running out
the clock. But with your testimony--

58
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,401
What do you mean,
running out the clock?

59
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,155
His cancer. His cancer is back.

60
002093 32,322 => 00209: 33,823
So he says.

61

00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,577
He didn't tell you?

62
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,750
Who's to say it's even true?
Lying piece of shit.

63
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,295
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

64
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,546
Fine. Okay?

65
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:54,552
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye
and he says if what I know is true-- "If."

66
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,764
--he'll be dead before I can prove it.

67
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,974
The balls on that son of a....

I got all these little pieces.
They're all part of the story.

69
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,440
They don't mean much on their own,
but when you tell me what you know...

70
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,403

I am here to help you.

this situation diminishes.

Just for my own protection, and just....

You know, it seems to make sense

that I should have someon

I mean, you start, you know,
getting defensive--

87
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,666
I'm not saying it's right,
but I'll tell you it's a fact...

-Skyler, yes, I do.

It's in your best interest...

What has she seen?

00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,474
Then let them help you.

377
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,393
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

 

378
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,438
You've got enough to get them

to believe your story at least.

 

 

 

379
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,440
Put the whole DEA on it.

380
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,151
That's how this is supposed to work,
right?

381
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,569
No.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

382
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,446
No?

383
00841: 31,155 => 00:41:34,075
What no? What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

384
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,953
-Look, baby--
-You've gotta go in with this, Hank.

385
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,998
Look, the day I go in with this...

386
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,419
...that's the last day of my career,
all right?

387
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:49,465
I'm going to have to walk in there,
look those people in the eye...

388
00241: 50,258 => 00:412 53,553
...and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year...

389
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,514
...is my own brother-in-law.

390
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,062
It's over for me.

391
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:10,445
Ten seconds after I tell this story,
I'm a civilian.

392
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:15,199
And then how can we help Skyler
if she comes to her senses?

393
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,619

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
When I go in there...

394
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:24,417
...I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.

395
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,674
I can be the man who caught him,
at least.

396
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,259
What if you wait...

397
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,012
-and they catch Walt without you?

398
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,766
If they find out that you knew
and you said nothing?

399
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,227
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?

400
00242:51,569 => 00:42:52,820
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.

401
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,615
Morning.

402
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,867
-Hey.
-Hey, boss.

403
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,497
-How you doing, Hank?
-Hey.

404
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,264
Hey. Look who's back.

405
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,517
I had to see it with my own eyes.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
406
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,394
-How you doing?
-Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?

407
002432.25,561 <-> 00:43:27, 939
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

408
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,899
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.

409
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,610
All right, don't make me sorry
I stopped by here.

410
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,613
Anyway, you got a budget meeting
in an hour...

411
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,492
...then a meet-and-greet with
the new prescription task force guys.

412
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:44,831
All right. Hey, you know, listen.

413
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,876
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed...

414
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,215
...and instead see if you could set up
a conference call with Ramey.

415
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,758
What for?

416
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,596
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing,
you know, for me.

417
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,932

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
All right. You got it.

418
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,561
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

419
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,896
No, what money thing?

420
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,317
Oh, you're gonna love this.
It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.

421
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,486
Pinkman?

422
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:19, 824
I'll give you this.
Jesse, you're never boring.

423
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,576
Not boring at all.

424
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,746
So come on, buddy, share with us.

425
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,917
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?

426
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,130
I promise you we can hold out
just as long as you can.

427
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,550
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the size of a hot water bottle.

428
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:41,095
Man, all that cash.
I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.

429

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,515
I know. But I don't think
I'd be tossing it out my car window.

430
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,144
Yeah. My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

431
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,105
-But apparently Jesse is raking it in.
-Yes, indeed.

432
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:55,109
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

433
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,819
Sure. He found it.

434
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,531
-Or won it in a card game, maybe.
-That's it. Won it in a card game.

435
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,366
Lucky night at the casino.

436
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05, 620
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?

437
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,252
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you
gather your thoughts...

438
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,130
...SO we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

439
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,593
Can we get you anything?
Coffee? A soda?

440
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,931
-Right.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Yeah. Thought not.

441
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,860
I have a history with Jesse Pinkman...

442
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:41,989
...and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

443
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,910
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

444
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,831
You said he wasn't talking?
Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.

445
002453 50,998 => 00:45:52,833
Despises me, okay?

446
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,170
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

447
00:45:56,337 --> 00:46:01,801
Then you guys go in, get what you need
from the little shit-stain, finish him off.

448
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:07,056
Gives me anything useful while
he's with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.

449
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,518
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

450
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:15,106
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on
our suspect for us, just for a few minutes.

451
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,608
Absolutely. I can do that.

00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,691
Hey, Mr. White. It's me.

2
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:29,154
I know you're probably
real busy with retirement...

3
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,074
...-but I got some news I think
you should maybe know about.

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,451
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion...

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,286
...and it got a little...

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,163
..-messy.

7
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,041
It's all straightened out now...

8
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,379
...but just a heads-up, there's been
a kind of change in management.

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,756
Anyway,
just thought you should know.

10
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50, 467
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details...

de
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,803
...-but, you know, it's cool,
so whatever.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55, 639
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,767
Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train...

14
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,311
..-pumping the water in, he's watching
to make sure we put in...

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,814
-exactly what he'd calculated.

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,359
We gotta be real precise because
water and methylene weigh different...

17

00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,028
-and he figured it all out to,
like, milliliter.

18
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm up there with my hose...

19
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,491
...we're going as fast as we can.
We only got a few minutes.

 

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,786
At the crossing, we got this guy
who's smooth-talking the engineer.

21
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,496
And it's all just going great...

22
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,333
...until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck...

23
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,044
...SO we're pretty much screwed,
because he can just push...

24

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00201426,253 =-> 00201: 29,673
...the entire dump truck off the tracks,
which, you know, is what he does.

25
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,174
Wait. What's your guy doing?

26
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,885
-You can't stop him?
-Yeah, but what's he gonna say?

27
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,640
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there."
28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,435
So I'm looking all around,
because I know we're not done...
29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,604

 

...-but the gallons
are slowly ticking away.

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,522
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

31
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,900
So I fling the hose, I'm grabbing the cap,

I'm screwing in the

bolts.

 

 

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,069
Just, like, busting ass, you know?
33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:56,575
And then I feel the train start moving
and I'm--
34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,493
“NOU EG: 3 .a.3

-I'm on top.

35
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-Did you piss your pants?
-Yeah, right?

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,584
So the thing starts speeding up,
so I jump off the moving train.

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,044
Like, total stuntman stuff.

38
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,463
It's like Hooper. You ever see Hooper?

39
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,506
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

40
00802211, 715 <> 003022 13,464
He jumped out of a helicopter,
not a train.

41
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,218
Whatever, man. It's a good movie.

42
00202:15,427 ==> 00:02:18, 972
This guy Jesse, he's underneath,
and the train just drives right over him.

 

43
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,516
And luckily he's this skinny little guy.

 

44
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24, 603
Damn. That's a tight operation.

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,397
It was perfect.

46
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,693
No one even knew they got robbed,
just like we planned.

47
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,614

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever...

48
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,616
...-like, potential money-wise.

49
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,993
So that's how that happened.

50
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,587
Can I get you anything else?

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,839
Nope. Thanks, darling.

52
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,092
I'm ready for the check.

53
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,234
You feeling good about cooking?

54
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
Yeah.

55
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,824
You'll be able to run your own lab?

56
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,827
-Do it up right?
-Yeah. For sure. I got this.

57
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,957
All right.

58
00203:327,582 =—> 00:03: 31,461
Let's make some money, then.
I gotta hit the head.

59
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,010
Ever been on a plane
and find yourself...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
60
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,304
...-looking down at the armrest
next to you...

61
00#03:41,513 => 00:03:45,517
...looking at the little plug
where the ashtray used to go?

62
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,229
I look at that and I say,
"What the hell happened to this country?"

63
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,772
Nanny state.

64
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,816
I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on...

65
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,570
...I wanna smack the shit out of him,
like, for his own good.

66
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,466
Mr. Pinkman.

67
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,052
How are you today?

68
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,264
Not so good, huh?

69
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:52,185
Of course, I might be able
to help you out.

70
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,606
I wanna talk to you about
your partner, Heisenberg.

71
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,569
See, I know he's my brother-in-law,
Walt.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
72
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,824
Oh, yeah. That's the look.

713
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:13,456
Lucky for you,
I'm more interested in him.

74
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,834
So I got an offer.

15
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,004
If you help me out here...

76
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,552
...tell me all about you and him
and your little meth business...

77
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,556
..-maybe I talk to my friends
at the A.P.D...

78
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,766
...and make all this go away.

719
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,062
I know he's the mastermind here.

80
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,315
PLUS sss

81
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,819
..-I'm thinking,
based on your recent activities...

82
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,449
...that maybe there's a little trouble
in paradise?

83
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,370
Maybe you guys aren't
getting along so good?

I'm right, aren't I?

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,627
Eat me.

86
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,173
Sure that's how you want to play this?

87
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,136
Why don't you try and beat it
out of me?

88
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,598
That's your thing, right?

89
00207:21,191 ==> 00:07:23,610
He really did a number on you,
didn't he?

90
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,994
I don't know...

91
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,959
...but happy people
usually don't go around...

92
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,712
...throwing millions of dollars away.

93.
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,299
I don't think...

94
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,220
...Walt's gonna be patting you
on the back for that.

95
00207351805 => 00207: 53,932
But maybe that's the point.

96

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,144
But, you see, I get that.

97
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,855
My own brother-in-law...

98
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,150
..-lying to me for over a year.

99
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,278
Using me.

00
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,991
Maybe you understand that feeling.

01
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,372
Help me out here, Jesse...

02
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,792
...and we can put him away.

03
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,587
I know you want that.

04
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,883
I think you wanna talk.

05
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,141
Not to you.

 

06

00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,103
Agent Schrader,

beat any good suspects lately?

107
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,023
Tall and taller, ask him
about his history with my client.

108
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,067
He knocked the poor kid unconscious
last time they were alone.

a civil rights lawsuit the size of Montana?

Because I'll oblige you.

1
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
So long, Rocky. Keep your left up.

2
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,369
Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.

3
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,705
I'm gonna try to remain calm...

 

 

4
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,417
...but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

115
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,754
My guys are busting their asses...

116
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,340
...trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds...

117
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,676
...and you're tossing yours
out a window?

118
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,306
And I have to hear about your little act
of philanthropy on the news?

11.9
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
Did you hit your head
or something?

120
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,144
Why didn't you call me

What did you say to Schrader?

122
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,106
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

123
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,817
Chill out? No.
No, I don't chill out right now...

124
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,487
...because things have gone nuclear.

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,200
I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

126
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,746
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

27
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,334
Just use the money that I gave you.

28
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,294
No, Saul. Saul, I--

29
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:51,007
Stop-- Saul. Stop talking. I don't care.

Work your magic.

Yesterday, I passed out.

54

Briefly. Very, very briefly.

55
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,782
And I did this.

56
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44, 662
Why did you pass out?

 

57
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:49,125

But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo...

.- which is why I've been so tired lately.

I just don't want you to worry.

What now?

66

What now is that we go on,
like always. Right?

Hey, don't worry about this, okay?

I won't again.

And what would really help me out...

you've kept this from them.

Look, whatever you think he did...

245
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,597
...this is not an ongoing situation.

-No.

They need to understand.
It's in the past.

It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

That affair of yours,

Please. Look, Junior just found out

He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

It's just not right.

256
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,425
I swear to God,
you start throwing the word "right" at me--

257
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,927
-What I mean--
-Was it right to run a drug empire?

258
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,929
There is no drug empire.

259
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,681
Lying to your son,

to all of us, is that right?

Why don't you kill yourself, Walt?

-What?
-Just kill yourself.

263

This whole thing dies with you.
That's what you're saying here?

264
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,906
Is that Hank should just let it go
and wait for you to die.

265
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,451
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die, then.

279
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,076
This is my confession.

280
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,662
If you're watching this tape...

281
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,039
...I'm probably dead...

282
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,043
...murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.

283
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,839
Hank has been building
a meth empire...

284
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,801
...for over a year now
and using me as his chemist.

285
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,679
Shortly after my 50th birthday...

286
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,182
...he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge...

287
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,519
...to cook methamphetamine,
which he would then sell...

288
00821: 10,728 <> 00:212 15,'608
...using connections that he made
through his career with the DEA.

289
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,695
I was astounded.

290

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,366
I.... I always thought Hank
was a very moral man...

291
00%21:24,575 ==> 00:21:27,578
...and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time...

292
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,665
...something he knew
and took advantage of.

293
00:21:32,792 =--> 00:21:35,377
I was reeling
from a cancer diagnosis...

294
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,256
...that was poised
to bankrupt my family.

295
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,468
Hank took me on a ride-along
and showed me just how much money...

296
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,471
...even a small meth operation
could make.

297
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,807
And I was weak.

298
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,187
I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin...

299
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54, 980
-so I agreed.

300
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:59,568
Hank had a partner, a businessman
named Gustavo Fring.

301
00221:59,777 --> 00:22:02,905

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Hank sold me into servitude
to this man...

302
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,408
...and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.

303
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,619
I didn't know where to turn.

304
00%22:10,120 ==> 00:22:13,707
Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out...

305
00:22:13,916 -->. 00:22:15,918
...and things escalated.

306
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,922
Fring was able to arrange...

307
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,134
...I guess--
I guess you call it a hit on Hank.

308
00222 $24,343 == 002225 27,221
It failed,
but Hank was seriously injured...

309
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,682
...and I wound up
paying his medical bills...

310
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,936
...which amounted
to a little over $177,000.

chee
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,399
Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.

312
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,404
Working with a man
named Hector Salamanca...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

313
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,489
-he plotted to kill Fring.

314
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,493
The bomb that he used
was built by me.

315
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,455
He gave me no option in that.

316
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,501
I have often contemplated suicide...

317
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,962
...but I'm a coward.

318
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,758
I wanted to go to the police...

 

319
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,887
...but I was frightened.

320
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,808
Hank had risen to become the head
of the Albuquerque DEA.

321
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,228
To keep me in line,
he took my children.

322
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,064
For three months he kept them.

B23:

00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,000
I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.

327
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,547
Recently, I tried once again to quit...

328
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,843
...and in response, he gave me this.

329
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,563
I can't take this anymore.

330
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,902
I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me...

331
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,198
...or worse, hurt my family.

332
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:16, 664
All I could think to do
was to make this video...

333.
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:22,336
...and hope that the world
will finally see this man...

334
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,297
...for what he really is.

335
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,143
Who do you think he's shown this to?

336
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,232
No one. It's a threat.

337
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,112

It's what he will do if I don't back off.

338
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,864
I think you should show this to Ramey.

339
00%24751,073 ==> 003243 53,117
Just get ahead of it.

340
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,121
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
Anybody who knows you will know.

A hundred and seventy-seven
thousand dollars?

How was I to know

-Why didn't you tell me?

352

Because I knew that
you would refuse it...

have been able to walk again.

Oh, Christ, Marie.

I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.

...otherwise, you know,
you'd be locked up.

He wants me to inform on you
for him.

372
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,320
Tell him everything we did.

373

Anything else?

Just him being there all by himself...

377
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,379
...and, plus,
he was acting kind of shady.

378
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,049
Seemed like he didn't
want the other cops...

379

00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,003
And what's here for you now anyway?

406
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,385
I tell you, if I could, I'd trade places.

407
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,763
A whole lifetime ahead of you...

the reset button.

409
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,394
In a few years...

410
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,649
...this might all feel like nothing more
than a bad dream.

411
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,581
Would you just, for once...

What are you talking about?

414

00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,883

 

 

 

Can you just stop working me for, like,
10 seconds straight?

415

00231:25,092 =-> 00:31:27,010

Stop jerking me around?

416

00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,055

Jesse, I am not working you.
417

OO#3L: 30,263 => 00s312 33,'642

Yes. Yes, you are.

418

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,686

All right, just drop the whole

concerned-dad thing...

419

00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,106

-and tell me the truth.

420

00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,691

I mean, you're acting like...
421

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44, 361

...me leaving town is all about me...

422

00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:50,158

 

 

...and turning over a new leaf,
but it's really-- It's really about you.

is never gonna let up.

425
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,625
Just say so.

426
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,378
Just ask me for a favor.

427
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,090
Just tell me you don't give a shit
about me...

428
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,050
...and it's either this....

429
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,223
It's either this or you'll kill me
the same way you killed Mike.

what this is all about?

Come on.

434
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,287
Just tell me you need this.

Skyler?

439
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,324
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

440
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,452
Can you take over the register for me?

Skyler?

442
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,216
It worked...

443
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,135
..and we're fine.

444
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,681
Okay?

445
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,434
We're fine.

446
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,013
So Palmer and Castanares...

 

447
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,724
...are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office...

448
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,727
-...keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.
-Yeah, I put them on it.

449
008352 03,935 => 0023.52 05,812
You wanna explain that to me?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

450
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,065
Yeah. Right.

451
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,944
Why the hell should I know anything?
They're just my guys, after all.

452
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,532
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.

453
00235317, 741, == 00735: 19,242
You got a history with this kid.

454
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,536
If he catches wind
that you're trailing him...

455
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,622
...and this explodes, he could sue.

456
00#35224,623 => 00:35: 28,918
Look, if I can't explain this to Ramey,
I gotta pull my guys.

457
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,379
Fine. Take them off.

458
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,469
I said, take them off.
What else you want?

459
002352 54,986 --> 00:35:56,655
I'm going out for a while.

00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,663
You know what, it's gonna have
to be another day. Reschedule it.

463
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,002
Last chance. You sure there's nobody
you wanna say bye to?

464
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,962
Nobody at all?

465
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,631
No.

466
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,593
This is it. Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

467
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,726
I need a new dust filter...

468

.for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

469
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,732
Can you help me with that?

470
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,067
Yeah, pickup.

471
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,363
He's hot. Not "hot" hot,
just a little hot.

472
00236:38,571 ==> 00:36:40,031
Currently out on bail.

473
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,534
Yeah, he knows the rules.

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,787
One hour. Okay, he'll be there.

475
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,791
And done.

476
002365 53,253 == 0073.63 57,132
Okay, this guy's fee is 125.

477
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,426
Your benefactor...

478
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,220
...asked me to send you out
with something extra.

479
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,847
Get you started, you know?

480
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,807
Keep you sitting pretty...

481
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,810
..-until you get into the groove
of your new life.

482
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,981
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

483
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,026

Seriously, this is the last of it...

484
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,071
...SO you might wanna think
about making a budget.

485
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,573
Hey, what are you doing?

486
00237:21,781 =-> 00:37:24,576

Put that out.

487
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,661
I mean it. Put it out.

488
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,081
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not
gonna let you sabotage this thing.

489
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,293
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high...

490
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,880
...So stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

491
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,637
Right. Well, that's a start.
Now, give with the dope.

Christ.

493
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:04,032
Some people are immune
to good advice.

494
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,993
I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.

495
00238:07,202 --> 00:38:10,371
Don't even think
about lighting up again.

496

Francesca, we got any bags?

497

the hell out of there.

Guy won't pick up the kid
if he's got company.

502

You got a phone?

503
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,814
Cops took it.

504
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
All right,

in case something goes wrong...

505

...guy doesn't show, whatever,
you give me a call.

Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

512
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,345
Just stay put like a good boy.
He'll pick you up, you pay him.

Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

Well, it's your life.

I imagine you get a say.

Want a suggestion?

How about Florida?

 

518

-Alaska.

Yeah.

What? I don't know what happened here.
What did I do?

541
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,827
You stole it off me.

542
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,538
You and him, you took it
out of my pocket, didn't you?

543

Calm down. Yes.
Okay. I had Huell lift your dope.

544

I told you I couldn't risk
the guy not taking you.

-What?
-The ricin cigarette!

548

He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,227
-Hey.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-Hi.

571
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,647
-What's going on?
-Not much.

572
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,736
-Yeah? Nothing?
-Nope. Things are fine.

573
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17, 822
-Good.
-Why?

574
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20, 867
Oh, no reason.

51D
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,295

You know what I found the other day...

576
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:37,466
..is that the-- The--

The latch on the soda machine wasn't...

577
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,179
..-latching.

578
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:45, 600
It's-- It's catching every time
that I stock that darn thing.

579
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,021
So I thought I'd check it out.

580
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,482
Great.

581
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25, 848
Thank you.

582
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,897
Exact change.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I like that. Thank you very much.

583
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,651
Okay.

584
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,986
And...

585
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,615
...please give this
to your car-care professional...

586
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,326
-...and have an A-1 day. Thank you.
-Thank you.

587
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,287
I just remembered
they gave me a prescription...

588
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,747
...to go pick up, so....
I forgot.

589
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54, 418
I'm gonna go head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

590
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56, 837
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.

00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,524
Jesse?

2
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,028
Jesse!

3
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56, 366
Show yourself right now!

4
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,897
I'll be in touch.

5
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,483
Okay. Hey, Huell.

6
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,737
Listen, I want you to swing by
the high school on your way to Saul's.

7
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,907
I can't believe he would
go after my son, but....

8
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44, 993
-You got it.
-And Kuby's at the car wash, right?

9
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,288
Parked right across the street.
All's quiet. No Pinkman.

0
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,415
Okay. Just find him.

1
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10, 644
Please leave a message.

2
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13, 980
Jesse, listen.

 

3
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,234

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here...

4
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,237
...and so thank you for that.

5
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,864
And I know you're angry.

6
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,408
I wanna fix this, okay?

7
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,119
Whatever it takes, all right?

8
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,081
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

 

9
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,417
Until then, just....

20
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,213
Just sleep it off, okay?

21
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,882
And then call me.

22
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,634
Be safe.

23,
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,763
How's it coming?

24
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,932
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

25
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,226
-Switch this out, we'll be good to go.
-Good.

26

00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,812
Do you want separate keys
for the different locks...

27
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,774
-...or do you want one working both?
-No, no, no. No re-key.

28
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,193
Same exact keys as before.

29.
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,821
Usually with a break-in,
people like to get new keys.

30
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,948
No, same keys, same locks.

Sak
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,075
The old keys
have to work here, okay?

32
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,994
-Okay.
-All right.

33
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,917
Good.

34
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,422
Good. Good, good, good.

35
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27, 846
Oh, no, no. Hey, guys, guys, guys.

36
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,600
=Cut that. Yeah, thise...
-That area's still pretty bad.

37
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,977
Right. We'll have to go over this
a lot more.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

38
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,854
We've made three passes already.

39
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,522
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

40
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,483
No, no, no. The smell has got
to be gone completely.

41
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,195
My wife is coming home,

and I can't have any odor, any stain...

42
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,574
..-any sign that anything
happened here.

43
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,242
Understand?

44
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,789
I-- I know. This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

45
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,375
Sir, we'd love to take
more of your money...

46
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,211
...but you've got gas soaked
through to your subfloor.

47
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,340
Until you pull this up
and get new carpet, new padding...

48
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,759
...this is as good as it gets.

49
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,481
Is that gasoline?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

50
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,692
-Ask Dad.
-Hey. Over here.

SL.
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,738
-What happened?
-What happened is that...

52
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,240
...I should sue someone.
That's what happened.

53
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,869
So I'm on my way to the drugstore,
and I have to stop to get some gas...

54
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,039
...and there is this
total pump malfunction.

55
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,374
You know what?
She shouldn't be in this room.

56
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46, 336
I mean, this is supposedly green,
but you know how it is.

57
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48, 838
You can close the windows
in the nursery...

58
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,716
-because it's really
only out here.

59
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,053
This is as good as it gets.

60
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,651
So...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

61

 

00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,821
..-pump malfunction?
62
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,449
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times...
63
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,578
...and I hear a chunk.
You know, the pump's nozzle.

64
00%10720,787 ==-> 003103 22,831
The metal thing.
The thing you squeeze?

65
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,252
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naiveté...

66
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,964
...I took to understand that gas is
no longer coming out of the nozzle...

67
008108 31,172 “> O0s102 34,214
.-+.-SO I pull out the hose to put it back
and whoosh!

68
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,928
Yeah, I am suddenly
soaked in gasoline.

69
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,349
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my groin.

70
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,813
So now I am in a panic.
I race home, I run inside the house...

71
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,524
...and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
72
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,775
I jump in the shower.

73
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,194
Its not. until
after I get out of the shower...

74
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,698
...that I realize
my gas-covered clothes...

75
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,536
..-have been soaking
in the living room rug this entire time.

76
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,206
mean, it's-- It's--
The whole thing is just so stupid.

77
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,625
I could have rinsed off at the station.

78
OOP: 07,834 => OOs11Le 09,62
Halfway home, I started to realize...

79
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,423
..wait a minute, there's a water hose
right there next to the air pump.

 

80
00: 213,631 --> 00:11:14,799
You know, for tires.

81
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,926
Anyway, so that was my day.

82
O0S11G17, 135 S=> 003113 19,304
How was yours?

83
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,807
-Dad?
-Yeah.

00: 323,433 --> 00: 227,103
Please, can you just tell the truth?
85
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,650
Tell-- What do you mean?
86
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,653
You fainted, didn't you?
87
00%11:36,905 => 00:11:38,615
Because you're sick again?
88
00: 238,823 --> 00: 241,201

You were pumping gas,

and the fumes..

 

89
00: 241,409 --> 00: 243,661
..they made you pass out again.
90
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,039
Just-- Just admit it.
91
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,374
No, the-- No.
92
00: 248,583 --> 00: 250,126
It was the pump.
93
00: 755,714 --> 00: 256,758
All AGH; Dayss
94
00: 256,966 --> 00:12:00,762

 

 

 

Maybe I did get a little

swimmy at one poin

95

a

00:12:00,970
seebut I did

00:12:03,264
I'm fine, and

--> 00:12:03,056
not faint. Okay?

96
--> 00:12:05,600
that's the truth.
97
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:10,563
However, in the best interest
of all of our continued good health...

98
008122 10,772 <> 00s.122 12,\690
...I don't think we can stay here.

99
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,610
-I mean, not until we get new carpet.
-Yeah.

100
00812<15,818 ==> 00312: 20,823
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,
they got plenty of space.

01
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,325
Hey, what about a hotel?

02
00212 $22,533 ==> 00212: 25,036
A hotel. That could be sweet.

03
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,788
A good one.

04
00212 827,247 == 002123 29,290
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.

05
00212:29,499 =-> 00:12:31,292
Could be a little family vacation.

06
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,044
Might be fun. What do you say?

 

07
00312:33,253 =-> 00:12:35,088
Why don't you put
some clothes together.

 

 

108
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,548
Yeah. All right.

109

..-AA meeting off the 40.

122
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,731
His buddies,
Beaver and what's-his-name?

123
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,942
Badger and Skinny Pete.
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

124
00:13:38,151 =-> 00:13:39,818
They could be covering for him.

125
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,323
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug
on the tall kid's mom's place.

126
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,826
For three hours straight, all he talked
about was something called Babylon 5.

27
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,746
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.

28
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,748
Pinkman's not in their system...

29
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,832
-...so the cops don't have him.
“Yet.

 

 

 

30
00213254,292 --> 00:13:56,336
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving...

131,
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,754
...called your guy back.

132
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,632
Somebody misses their first chance
with my guy, there's no second.

133
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,594
Well, keep looking.

34
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,429
What then?
35

00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,598
What do you mean?

36
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,475
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.

I just need to explain to him
why that had to happen.

00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,409
Okay, but say, you know,
just for the sake of argument...

I-- I-- I can't believe you two.

473
00#38221,591. <-> 00:38: 24,803
The dude wanted me out of town
before I came to burn his house down...

474
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,846
...and now I'm more of a threat to him.

475
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,766
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy
on threats, you know?

476
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,894
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man, is why not.

477
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,063
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

478
00838: 35,271 -—> 00:38238,316
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

479
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,403
I agree. Except when it comes to you.

480
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,406
He cares about you.

481
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:46,699
Can't you see?

482
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:52,121
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not
ripping me off or calling me an idiot...

483
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,124
...or poisoning people
that I care about?

484
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,461
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

485
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,297
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

486
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,466
He paid for your rehab...

487
00239303, 716 ==> 00739% 05, 927
..ran over those two drug dealers
with his car.

488
00239: 06,135 =-> 00:39:07,595
Sounds like he saved your life.

489
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,139
Made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

490
002392 10,348 => 00:39: 13,351
Yeah, he sort of did.
I'm the only one near as good as him.

491
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,228
I don't know. The way you tell it...

492
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
...sounds like he's manipulating you
to stick around.

493
00239:17,689 =-> 00:39:20,775
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.
All those numbers he runs on you...

494
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,528
...over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

495

00239323, 7386 == 00739% 25,363
Look how far he'll go to show you--

496
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,199
To convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

497
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,035
-That's what this is.
-What if it's about...

498
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,037
..-killing me, you know?

499
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,415
You know, getting me out in the open...

500
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,793
...hire some-- Some clock-tower guy...

501
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,505
...or have me sit on a poisoned needle
or something, you know?

502
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,090
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

503
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47, 886
The plaza's one of the most wide-open
public places in all of Albuquerque.

504
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49, 387
It's the middle of the day.

5.05
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,140
And Agent Gomez and I will
be right there with you.

506
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:57,478
Look, you two guys
are just guys, okay?

507

00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,399
Mr. White, he's the devil.

508
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,568
You know, he is.
He is smarter than you...

509
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,820
...-he is luckier than you.

510
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,615
Whatever-- Whatever you think
is supposed to happen...

511
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,035
..-I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite of that...

5.12
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,703
...is gonna happen, okay?

 

513
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,582
Jesse, Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

514
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,918
This is not asking.

515
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,880
Unless you know another way to get the
man or you wanna take your chances...

516
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,050
..-with the banger boys over in MDC,
then this is it.

517
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,969
This is what's happening.

518
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,098
-I gotta piss. Can I piss?
-Yeah. Down to the left.

You got another SD card?

00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,567

-What?

-What if the kid's right?

521

00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,985
What if it's a trap?

The kid?

...that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

Well,

then, he's right.

526

00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,998
Pinkman gets killed...

527

00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,501
-and we get it all on tape.

528

00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,427

Remember,

you're hurt, angry,

but you're here for answers, okay?

529

00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,347

But don't....

Don't push the questions.

530

00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,308

Okay?

Let's not get him suspicious, all right?

531

00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,186

You let him do the talking, right?

532
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,605
Just relax. That's what matters most.

533
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,816
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

534
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,153
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

535
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,947
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?

536
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,534
-Loud and clear, idiota.
-How's it looking, Gomey?

537
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,203
No change.

538
00941:37,453 => 00:412 39,038
He's just sitting there.

539
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,581
Are we doing this, or what?

540
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,167
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

541
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,590
All right. Time to go.

 

542
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,561
Okay.

 

543
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,547

00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,633
He's just standing there.

545
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,135
What the hell is he doing?

546
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,286
He's on the move now.
He's taking off. I think he's running.

547
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,497
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.

548
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,259
You got him? He's at the pay phone.

549
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,469
Who the hell is he calling?

550
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,932
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.

55.1,
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,767
No. Come on.

552
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,990
Hello?

553
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,034
Nice try, asshole.

554
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,413
Jesse, where are you?

555
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,664
I just wanna talk.

556
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:30,001
No. I'm not doing what you want
anymore. Okay, asshole?
557
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,379
This is just a heads-up
to let you know I'm coming for you.

558
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,050
See, I decided that burning down
your house is nothing.

559
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,429
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

560
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,514
Jesse, listen.

561
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,101
Jesse? Jesse?

-Daddy! Daddy!
-Hey!

563
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,809
Get in.

564
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,438
Son of a bitch! Stupid, high little--

565
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,190
What the hell was that all about?

566
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,816
What were you thinking?

567
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,027
-Thinking there's another way.
-What?

568
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,822
To get him. There's another way.

569

A better way.

Hey.

571
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,891
It's Walt.

How big's the batch?

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,928
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,846
Uncle Jack, that mask...

4
002002 13,012 => 00:00: 15,015
...-I think you should....

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,809
Mr. White said the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,853
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,898
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,355
Seventy-six percent.

9
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,024
-Nice going, nephew.
-Thanks, Uncle Jack.

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,484
Where's the blue?

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,279
-Where's the what?

-The blue color.

 

 

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,990
Does it come later,
when this hardens?
3
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
Where is it?

4
OOF 01: 16,118 => 00: 012 19,913
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

 

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,958
See, I'm thinking the headline here
should be "76 percent."

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,084
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.

17

00%01:25,252 ==> 00:01:27,963
That dude who looked like Wolverine?
He couldn't crack 70.

18

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,467
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

19
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,136
And congratulations, Todd.

20
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,847
But blue is our brand, all over Europe.

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,224
It's what our buyers pay top dollar for.

22
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,101
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days...

 

 

23
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,939
.-maybe they'll let us slide on that,
but not if it's not blue.

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,652
I don't know. To my eye...
25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,488
-...it's kind of blue.
-Yeah, a little.

26
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,782
It's bluish.

27
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,121
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

28
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,420
Yeah, kind of.

29
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,339
If it catches the light just right...

30
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:15,385
...I could see how you'd think
there's a touch of blue...

31
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,638
»«.blue-green in there.

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,432
-Aquamarine.
-Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,184
Make it any damn shade you want.

34
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,561
Yeah, like they do
farm-raised salmon. Yeah.

35
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,773
I mean, Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

36
00202:27,939 =-> 00:02:29,524
Like, flamingo pink.
37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,362
It sure as hell don't come out
the ocean looking like that.

38
00%02:35,947 ==> 00:02: 39,201
All right. Let's make some money.

39
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,841
-Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
-Lydia.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,843
Thank you.

41
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,852
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

42
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,440
You sure? If it's too weak or something,
I can go put another bag in it.

43
00203210,607 ==> 00:03:12,317
I'm sure.
44

00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,947
Look, about the product...

45
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,825
-I'm really sorry about the color.

 

46
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,786
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot...

 

47
00203%22,953 --> 00:03:24,579
...in the mixing kettle, I think.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,833
I might've just
cooked the color right out of it.
49
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,086
You burned it, like a cake.

50
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,215
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,217

But the point is I think I can fix it...

52
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,721
.».-and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,892
I mean, I'm doing everything
just like Mr. White taught me, so....

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,438
You know,

it's bound to get better, right?

55
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,023
I appreciate you making
every possible effort...

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,319
...because, as you know,

my buyers expect a certain threshold...

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,738
...a continuity.

58
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,157
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

59
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,165
About your buyers...

60
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,754
...I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them...
61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,216
..-if you want.

62
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,805
I'll pass. Thanks.

63
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,601
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,520
I believe in you.

65
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,190
Please do make the cook better.

66
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,109
It's very important to me.

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,617
I've got a flight to catch.

68

00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,942
-Hello.

-Hey. It's Walt.

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,652
Hey, Mr. White. How you doing?

 

 

70
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm okay.
71
00:05:20,487 =-> 00:05:22,113
Tess: @ 6
72

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,077
Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

73
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,996
Oh, okay.
You want me to set up a meeting?

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,416
I-= Yes. Please. let's. do that.

75
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,962
Any heads-up I should give him, like...

76
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,715
...which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

77
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,302
-Mr. White?
-Just one target.

78
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,680
Not currently in jail.

719
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,224
Jesse Pinkman.

80
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,017
You got it.

81
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm surprised you didn't strangle him.
So now what? Book him?

82
00206351, 786 ==> 00206: 55,332
I'm sure the AUSA will have plenty to say
about how to play him against Walt.

83
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,460
Knowing what we know about
how Walt deals with rats behind bars?

84
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,462
Punk has to be safer
with the marshals...

85
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,422
...than out here
where it's open season.

86
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,218
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

87
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,762
The kid's got an idea.

88
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,222
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

89
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,558
The one that screwed up our sting?
I'm all ears.

90
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,311
Just hear him out, would you?

91
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,404
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

92
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,407
You guys need evidence
to put him away.

93
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,077
Only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

94
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,745
So you say.

95
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,246
Well, I know some evidence...

96
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,291
...that greedy asshole
would never destroy.
97
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,211
His money.

98
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,713
-You know where he keeps his money?
-No.

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,633
But I know someone who might.

100
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,140
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

101
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,352
Trailed him to the Dog House,
picked him up there.

102
00207:57,519 ==> 00:07:59,312
Seemed to be looking for someone.

103
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,773
-Had a lot of questions.
-No calls though, right?

104
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,609
-You got his phone?
-Yeah.

105
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,823
-He's on ice?
-Safe house off Rio Bravo.

106
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,033
We've got Van Oster babysitting him.

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,286
Yeah. What about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

108
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,872
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.
00:08:18,039
Goo

00:08:19,249
I gotta tell you

00:08:21,501
If this

109
=~-> 00:08:19,082
d job.

110
==> 00:08: 21,334
this up front, Hank.

111
--> 00:08:23,628
guy decides

he wants to lawyer up...

00:08:23,795
-I don't care
I'm gonna put

00:08:27,507
He won't

00:08:44,941
What the

00:09:07,672
You

00:09:18,725

Hey there.

LL2

--> 00:08:27,340
if you are my boss,
a stop to this.

3
--> 00:08:29,509
lawyer up.

4
--> 00:08:46,067
hell, man?

5
--> 00:09:09,007
‘re up.

6
--> 00:09:21,061
You mind

taking it outside for a minute?

 

 

7
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,438
“No, Sig. Yow got. 1b.
-All right, thanks.
18
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,775
Huell Babineaux.
19
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,611
Know who I am?
20
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,531
I'll take that as a yes.
21:
009094 33,698 =-> 007093 35,575
Thanks for your patience.

122
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,455
As Agent Gomez said,
you're not under arrest.

123
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,540
Why am I here?

124
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,877
Well, you're here
for your own protection, sir.

125
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,128
How you figure that?

126
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,091
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

27
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,305
Nice poker face.

28
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,182
Look, relax.

29
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,018
There's not much new you can tell me
about Walter White.

30
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,020
Multiple murders...

31
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,189
..ties to a white-power prison gang...

 

32

00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,067

..ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

133
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm not asking,
you're not answering...

134
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,780
. .whoop-de-do.
Let's cut to the chase.

135
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,949
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

136

00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,745
We intercepted a call between him
and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.

 

137
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,498
You know, your employer?

138
00%10723,665 ==> 00:10:26,626

Anyway, in the call, Walt said
that he was going to, quote:

139
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,295
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"

UNQUOTRS «-

 

 

40
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,590
-and that you were next on the hit list.
That's why you're here.

41
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,843
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.

 

42
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,387
I got the recording.

I can-- I can let you hear it.

143
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,014
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

 

144
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,308
Some carrottop named Patrick Kuby.
145
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,978
Boston P.D. ran him out of Beantown
a few years back.

146
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,604
Came out here for the sunshine.

147
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,816
Walt said he was gonna do this Kuby guy
the same way he does you.

148
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,026
In fact, Kuby's already missing.

149
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,905
Sorry to say, things are looking grim
for your-- Your redheaded buddy.

150
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,284
Believe us, don't believe us.

Suit yourself.

5.
002102 59,450 => 00s112 01,870
Whatever you do,

I would not call Goodman.

52.
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,913
He sold you down the river bigtime.

53

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,583
-The hell you talking about?
-Don't take it personally.

 

 

54
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,836
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

155

00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,672
To be fair, your circus clown of a boss
did try to spare you for all of, what...

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,633
...about 15 seconds...

157
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,094
...-before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

158
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,014
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone...

159
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,724
..and as soon as you call him...

160
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,809
..-Walt will find out
where you're hiding.

161

O0811224,976 =-> 003113 28,229.

Then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

162
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,027
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God,
I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.

 

163
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,155
-I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
-Relax.

164
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,490
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup...

165
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,577
...for conspiracy to commit murder
instead of under our protection.

166
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,080
Tell us everything you know
so we can get him before he gets you.

167
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,082
Why would he wanna kill me?
168
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,418
-I ain't do nothing.
-Who knows with this guy?

169
O0S11<750,585 s=> 003118 52,545
From what he said,
it may have to do...

170
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,925
-with him tying up loose ends regarding
poisoning some kid named Brock.

171
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,179
Or maybe it's because
you know where his money is.

172
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,139
I don't know where his money is.

173
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,599
That ain't what we heard.

174
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,935
You ain't listening
to the people in the know.

175
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,062
Me and Kuby rented a van
for the dude...

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,940
...loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit...

177
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,651
..-handed over the keys to him
at Goodman's.

178
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,028
Who knows where he took it
from there?
179
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,822
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

180
00#12:20,448 => 00:12: 22,033
Seven barrels' worth.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,576
Seven barrels?

182
00212:25,453 =-> 00:12 29,207
When you say "barrels,"
you mean "barrels" barrels?

183
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:34,587
Barrels, man. You know,
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

184
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,089
I got them at Home Depot.

185
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,757
Filled up every last damn

one of them too.

186
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,053
And where did you rent the van?

187
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,015
Lariat. The one

on Candelaria and Monroe.

188

00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,812

-Lariat on Candelaria?
-Yeah.

 

 

189
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,274
Kuby rented the van.
Mr. White dropped it off.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,068
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

00:

12:57,235
Wash the

00%12:58,611
It was filthy, man,
like he went off-road with it.

00:13:01,614
After we had hosed it down,

he grabbed a shovel out the back...

00:13:04,742

..-handed

191
--> 00:12:58,444
rental? Why?

192
--> 00:13:01,447

193
--> 00:13:04,575

 

194
--> 00:13:07,453
over the key,

and that was it.

00:13:07,620
That's all I know.

00:13:12,292
All right,

00:13:16,045
Agent Gomez
to do everything we can...

00:

3:20, 300

195
--> 00:13:08,913

196
--> 00:13:14,752
Mr. Babineaux.

197
=-> 00:13:20,133
and I are going

198
--> 00:13:21,843

.to find this son of a bitch.

00%
Like

OO:

34227010

199
--> 00:13:23,469

I said, you're free to go.

200

3:23,636 --> 00:

3: 26,597

But if I were you,

I wouldn't take one step out that door.

00:
And

00:
Oh,

201
3327,056 --> 00:

202

 

3:29,434 --> 00:

 

3:29,267

remember, no phone calls.

3: 31,019

actually, I almost forgot.
203
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,229
I took the liberty
of removing the battery...

204
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,648
-so Walt can't track you by GPS.

205
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,609
So don't put that back in.

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,819
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

207
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,323
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

208
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,119
Don't discuss the case with him
because the less you distract him...

209
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,538
...the better he can protect you.

210
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,124
How long you gonna be?

211,
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,502
As long as it takes to keep you safe.

212
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,017
So just one guy this time.

213
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,478
Not even in lockup.

214
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,359
Some former partner, Todd says?

 

 

 

215
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,820
Yeah.
216
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,073
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?
217
00214 227,158 ==> 00214: 29,035
Rat p--?
218
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,537
No, no.
219
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,999
Rat patrol? No. No, he's not a rat.
220
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,252
He! s! Justice «
221.
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,384
He just won't listen to reason.
222
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,677
-Okay.
-He's just angry.
223
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
He's not a rat.
224
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,598
All right.
225
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,935
Angry non-rat. Got it.
22:6
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,728
How angry we talking, by the way?
227
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,647
Like, Hulk angry?
228
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,984
Like, Rambo-James Bond
badass individual?

229
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,534
Not something you'd do yourself, huh?

230
002153 10,910 ==> 00215: 12,787
Jesse is like family to me.

231
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,835
Look, I want what you do
to be quick and painless.

232
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
No suffering, no fear.

233
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,090
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

234
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,050
I respect that.

235
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,470
-There's too many savages out there.
-Let's just talk about the money.

236
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,889
No, we don't want your money.

237
002153 33,599 ==> 00215: 35,101
We want you to cook for us.

238
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,029
You know I'm out of the business.

239
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,700
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

 

 

240
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,870
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,414
Get the color right too.

242
00315:56,581 =-> 00:15:59,417
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it...

243
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,836
...it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

244
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,090
-So I'm told.
-No. Absolutely not.

245
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,969
Look, what was the price per head
last time? I'll triple it.

246
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,514
A drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

247
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,184
Don't skimp on family,
that's what I always say.

248
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,768
You want us to do this job?

249
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,938
Do it right? That's the price.

250
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,744
One cook...

251
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,413
..after the job is done.

252)
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,893
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

253
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,270
Do him tonight if you want.

254
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,314
Just tell me where he is.

255
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,150
I don't know where he is...

256
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,363
-but I know how to flush him out.

257
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,119
You want string cheese
or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?

 

 

258
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,704
Both.

25.9
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,999
-I didn't hear you.
-Both, please.

260
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,965
Hold on, honey.

261
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,262
Hi, Andrea.
I don't know if you remember me.

262
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,347
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.

263
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,599
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi.
-Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,101
Oh, hi. Hi.
265
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,853
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this...

266
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,941
..-but I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

267
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,484
It's about Jesse.

268
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,904
Sure. I'm sort of rushing around
right now.

269
00217:52,071. =-> 00:17:54,031
Wanna talk inside
while I get my boy ready?

270
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,577
Oh, well, yeah. If it's--
If it's okay, yeah, sure.

271
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,870
Thank you.

272
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,959
-You met Brock before, right?
-Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.

213
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,294
How you doing, Brock?

274
00218:09,547 ==> 00:18:11,173
Brock, he asked you a question.

2715
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,051
-I'm good.
-Good.

276
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,845
Froot Loops.

277
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,763
That's good stuff.

278
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,017
So Jesse....

279
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,518
Yeah, I....

280
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,978
I don't wanna alarm you...

281
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,689
..-but I've been trying

to reach him for days.

 

 

282
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,149
I've stopped at his house...

283
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,027
.I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail...

284

00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,363

..and he won't return my calls.
I can't find him anywhere.

 

 

285
00218:34,530 ==> 00318: 35,990
Have you heard from him?

286
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,784
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

287
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,538
That was, I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.

288
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,999
Andrea...
289
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,129
.Jesse's using again, andl....

290
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,840
I have a bad feeling about this.

291
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,552
Have you tried calling the police?

292
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,890
Or a better idea.

293
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,268
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

 

 

294
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:08,022
I mean, he may have ways of finding
Jesse without getting him in trouble.

295
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,400
"Better call Saul." Yeah. I-- I did that.

296
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,903
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up...

297
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,240
-but, otherwise, very little help.

298
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,410
You see, the thing is...

299
O0819+21,577 ==> 00319: 24,705
.-is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

300
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:30,127
And I won't bore you
with the details, but he's....
301
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,965
He's-- He's pretty upset with me and....

302
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,885
And I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back...

303
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,931
-instead of him being....

304
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,725
WéLd «sax

305
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,271
Well, I'll try him right now.

306
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,441
I mean, if that's it, he's mad at you...

307
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,404
-...maybe I'll have better luck.
-That would be such a help. Yes.

 

 

308
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,532
What--? What--?
What number are you calling him on?

309
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,494
-His cell.
-You know, he recently got a new one.

310
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,496
And there. That--

311
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,958
That's his new number there,
the highlighted one.

312
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,923
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

313
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,468
Your friend Walter just dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.

314
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,846
We-- We're thinking of you.

315
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,223
Call me back as soon
as you get this message.

316
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,891
I really need to hear from you.

317
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,102
It's important.

318
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,980
Thank you, Andrea.

 

319
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,274
I appreciate that.

320
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,193
Well, I better-- I better be going.

321
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,280
You're welcome to stay a few minutes
to see if he calls back.

322
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,032
No, no, no. You're trying to get
your son off to school.

323:
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,744
If he does happen to call back,
would you call me?

324
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,539
Better yet, I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

325
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,584
And thank you.

326
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,004
See you, Brock.

327
00221 324,116 ==> 002213 25,284
We on?

328
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,078
Yes. It should be any time now.

32:9)
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,789
Copy that.

330
00221:29,955 =-> 00:21:33,542
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

 

 

331
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,545
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

332
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,547
You got it.

333
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,096
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

334
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,142
Your friend Walter just dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.

 

 

335
00221:50,309 ==> 00:21:52,353
We-- We're thinking of you.

336
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,647
Call me back as soon
as you get this message.

337
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,357
I really need to hear from you.
338
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,192
It's important.

33.9
00222:01,529 =--> 00:22:03,989
Nice try, asshole.

340
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,884
How'd it go at the rental place?
Van have GPS?

341
00:22:24,051 =-> 00:22:25,970
No GPS. Nope.

342
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,931
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago...

343
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,475
...when the ACLU or somebody
sued them...

344
00222:31,642 =-> 00:22:33,477
..and they had to get rid of it.

345
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,485
Well, that's it. Game over.

346
00#22:41,652 =—-> 00°22: 44,530
Yo, man, you can't just give up on this.

347
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,949
-Who said we're giving up?
-What do you got?

348
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,285
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said...

349
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,369
..-about the van being dirty...
350
0022:51,5387' --> 00422: 53,455
...and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

35.1
00#22:53,956 => 00:22: 55,875
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

352
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,210
No kidding. So what?

353
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,505
There's a whole lot of desert out there.
How we gonna find the spot?

354
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,883
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

355
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,553
Yeah. But Walt doesn't know that.

356
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,390
All right.

357
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,102
Here's your change.

358
00#23215,269 => 00:23: 17,395
-Oh, count it out, please.
-Here:

359
00223::17,563 --> 00°23:19,397
Three. That makes 15.

 

360
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,192
Plus 5, that is 20.

 

361
00223:3.22,359 =--> 00:23:25,529
-Give this to your car wash professional.
-Thank you.
362
00223%25,696 --> 00723: 27,031
Say it.

363
00:23:27,197 =-> 00:23:30,367
-Have an A-1 day.
-Oh, you too.

364
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,162
-Good.
-Why--? Why do I--?

365
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,372
Why do I gotta say that?

366
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,583
Because it reinforces our brand.

367
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,752
So getting the hang of it?

368
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,088
It's-- It's pretty basic.

369
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,925
Mom, it's Saturday.

370
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,509
Can--? Can I go?

371
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,262
-Go where?
-Home.

372
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,890
Pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

373
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,975
I'm sure the smell is gone by now.

374
00:23:55,142 =-> 00:23:57,770
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer?

375
009233 57,0937 => 00223: 59,897
-I need you.
“Fil

376
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,440
Who do I give this to?

377
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,361
You know what? I'll take care of it.
Excuse me, son.

378
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,988
That'll be 14.97, please.

379
00%24:13,953 ==> 00:24:15,079.
Hey. How you doing?

380
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,873
You're on our billboard. You're--

381
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,626
-You're the lawyer guy, yeah.
-"Better call Saul!"

382
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,049
Okay.

383
00224 427,216 == 002243 31,929
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30...

384
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,599
...35, 40, and 10 makes 50. Thank you.

385
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,267
I like your commercial.

386
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,061
What--? What happened to your face?
387
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,106
Oh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

388
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,109
Thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

389
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,528
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

390
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,238
-Yeah.
-Don't drink and drive.

39.1,
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,533
-Okay.
-But if you do, call me.

392
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,702
Have an A-1 day.

393
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,037
Mom, you forgot to say it.

394
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,748
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.

395
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,877
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

396
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,214
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.

397
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,758
What the hell you doing here?

398
00%25:09,.925 => 00:25:12,761
I swear to God, the kid left
so much booger powder in there...
399
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,722
.-my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.

400
00#25214,888 => 00:25:17,391
Is your phone broken? All 200 of them?

401
00:25:17,683 -->. 00:25:19,685
Huell's gone.

402
008252 159,852 => 00325: 21,311
Huell's gone where?

 

403
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,149
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

404
00825425,815 ==> 003258 27,234
So, what about Jesse?

405
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,527
He hasn't shown up yet.

406
00#25:29,695 --> 00:°25:32,156
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite...

407
002253 32,322 => 00:25: 34,116
...and hasn't gotten our message yet.

408
00225234,283 --> 00:25:36,785
Or he got it loud and clear,
figured out it's a setup.

409
00%25736,952 ==> 003253 39,747
The kid is not as dumb as you think.

410
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,505
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

411
00:25:48,672 =-> 00:25:51,383
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

412
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,344
Look, I had him
watching the Dog House...

413
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,096
..-figuring the kid might show up.

414
00225156,263 => 00:25:58,265
Next thing I know, radio silence.

415
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,893
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

416
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,812
Jesse is not on some killing spree.

417
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,231
It's me he wants.

418
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,733
It's just me.

 

419
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,567
Well, then where the hell's Huell?

420
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,745
-Any news?
-Not yet, but soon. I promise.

421
00226:20,120 ==> 00:26:22,206
Have an A-1 day.

422
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,173
Next, inventory lists.

423
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,138
These are the inventory lists.
Every day, after close of business...
424
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,225
»..you tally the total
of every item sold...

425
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,560
..-and you mark it
under the appropriate column.

426
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,940
So say we sold, I don't know,
10 pine-scented air fresheners.

427
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,275

You mark "10" under this column...

428
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,736
...and then you subtract 10
from the stock column.

429
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,072
Okay? Why don't you try that?

430
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,376
Jesse?

431
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,752
Got my photo, bitch?

432
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,754
That barrel look familiar?

433
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,966
Because I just found six more
exactly like it.

434
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,808
That big bastard
who works for Goodman...

435
00227:322,975 =-> 00:27:25,227
...I pistol-whipped that melon
he calls a head...

436
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,480
...till he gave up what he knew,
which led me to your rental van...

437
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,400
...which, it turns out, had GPS.

438
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,736
How do you like that, genius?
Guess you didn't think of everything.

439
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,115
Look, Jesse, I don't know
what you plan on doing here, but--

440
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,868
Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.

441
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:45,122
It involves a couple of five-gallon cans
of gasoline and a lighter.

442
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,374
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.

443
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,084
No, you listen to me, bitch.

444
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,669
You get your ass out here
as fast as you can.

445
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,463
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!

446
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,176
And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?

447
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,469
You hang up on me, put me on hold...

448
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,430
..lose my call for any reason...

449
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,308
»..as soon as you do,
I'm burning all of it.

450
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,227
All right? One big bonfire.
You get the picture?

451
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,063
-I get it, I get it. Okay.
All right. You better hurry...

452

00228210,230 ==> 00:28:12,357
...because I'm burning

10 grand a minute...

453
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,443
..-till you get here, starting right now.

454
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,404
I said, I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

 

455
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,824
Fire in the hole, bitch.
There goes 10 G's.

 

456
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,453
-Oh, nice orange flames.
-No, no, no!

457
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,541
Jesse-- Jesse, please.

458
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,669
I'm dying. My cancer is back.

459
002283 32,836 ==> 00:28: 36,215
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

460
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,425
I can't spend this money.

461
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,678
It's not for me. I won't be around
long enough to use it.

462
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,347
It belongs to my children.

463
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,183
Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.

464
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,143
You're seriously gonna go there?

465
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,439
I am sorry about Brock.

466
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,982
No, you're not.

467
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,026
-I am.
-You're not, but you're gonna be.

468
00228356,193 == 00228% 59,071
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

469
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,864
But he's alive, isn't he?

470
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,950
He's fine, just as I planned it!

471
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,662
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?
00:

472
29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,872

That I had it all measured out?

00:

Come on!

473
29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,459

-Don't you know me by now?

-I know you're a lying, evil scumbag...

Manipulating people...

29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,674

-Open your eyes!

477
29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,552
t you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

478
29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,721

I ran over those gangbangers!

00:

479
29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,808

I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?

00:
I did all of those things

Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?

Son of a bitch.

Yeah?

497

It's me. I've got Jesse in sight...

...and he's coming for me right now.

499

He knows I'm alone.

-Let's go, boy.
-I'm guessing he's got backup.

501
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,813
-How many guys?
-I do-- I-- I don't know.

-Where are you?
-To'thajiilee.

Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

You know, where we used
to cook out with the family.

Gomey thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up...

of losing your cash...

the busywork, Walt...

560
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,420
...and point out the spot
where you buried your money?
561
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,718
No?

562
00239:06,469 => 00:39:07,971
No matter.

563
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,391
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

564
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,771
Agent Gomez, should we flip a coin
for the honors?

565
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,566
No way, man. It's all yours.

566
00239221,526 --> 00:39:22,902
Walter White...

567
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,321
..you have the right to remain silent.

568
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,991
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

569
00839228,157 => 00:39: 29, i614
...in a court of law.

570
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,578
You have the right
to speak to an attorney...

S71
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,496
...and have an attorney present
during questioning.

572
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,373
If you cannot afford an attorney...
573
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,293
...one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

574
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,505
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

575
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,466
Coward.

576
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,652
-Get-- Get over here!
-Bring it!

577
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,655
-Get in the truck, will you?
-Bring it, bitch!

578
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,616
-Put him in the car!
-Come on!

5719
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,076
Get in the car! Hurry up!

580
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,832
Get in the car, kid. Come on.

581
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,385
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

582
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,804
You should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

583
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,974
-You got it.
-I'd take the kid with me...

584
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,102
...-but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

585
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,105
-Congratulations, buddy.
-Hey.

586
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,279
I'll call the tribal police,
let them know we're here.

587
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,074
Gonna make a phone call.

588
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:11,010
Hank, why is there what looks like
brains in our garbage can?

589
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,846
Hey, baby. I got him.

590
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,056
Dead to rights.

591

00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,060

-You got Walt?
~Yeah.

592
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,813
I got him in handcuffs as we speak.

 

593
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,440
Want me to wave to him for you?

594
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,406
Well, he's not--

595
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,408
He's not feeling too friendly.

596
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,369
Oh, my God.
597
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,454
You did it.

598
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,541
Thank God.

599
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,585
Things are gonna be a little rough
for the next couple weeks...

600
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,045
-but they'll get better.

601
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,510
Baby, you okay?

602
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,348
I'm much better now.

603
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,436
LI. gotta: go..

 

604
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,980
It may be a while before I get home.

605
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,861
I love you.

606
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,197
I love you too.

607
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,228
Who the hell is this?

608
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,397
Tribal police?

609
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,986
Hank! Hank! Hank!
610
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,338
No--

611
00:43:19,097 ==> 00:43:21,557
Police! Drop your weapons!

612
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,892
Jack, don't do it!

613
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,521
Jack!

614
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,318
Drop your weapons!

615
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,445
You heard the man! Put them down!

616
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,823
How do we know you're cops?

617
002432 37,115 <-> 00343: 39,114
Show us some ID!

618
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,703
Damn straight! Let's see some badges!

 

619
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,664
Jack!

620
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,417
Jack, don't do it! Jack!

621
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,214
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!

622
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,342
We'll give ourselves up,

00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,272
Yo, so, what's next?

2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,774
We wait.
3

00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,819
We don't got like eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

4
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,405
The reaction has begun.

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,784
Yeah, I know. So how long?

6
002002 33,992 => 00: 00%38,330
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed
liquid would cool more quickly...

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41, 667
...because, of course,
this is an exothermic reaction...

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,877
.- which means "giving off heat."

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,129
And our desired product is....

0
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,508
Put me into a coma, why don't you?

1
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,094
What did you just say?

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,180
What? What? Nothing.

 

3
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,400
No, no, no. Not in here.

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,860
Like I'm an idiot.

5
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,114
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

6
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,865
Dick.

7
O0#01:24,585 <-> 00: 012 27,921
God. Jesus. God.

 

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,756
Shut up.
9

00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,44
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49, 90
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

21
00201 %50,1710 == 00201252,57:
He's got a stick up his butt?

 

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,782
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

 

 

23
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,494
So anyway, he's insisting that I--

24
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,956
He's demanding that I stay...

25
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,375
...and look over his system...

26
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,003
...and I cannot get out of it.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,548
Yeah.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,685
“Hello.
-Hi, honey. It's me.

29
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26, 647
-Hey, you. What's going on?
-Nothing much.

30
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:32,611
I was just calling
to say I'm sorry...

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,072
...-but I'm gonna be late tonight.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,449
Bogdan. He's got a bug up his butt.

33
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,703
That's okay. I wasn't planning anything
special for dinner, so....

34
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,208
In fact, you could take pity on us
and bring a pizza home.

35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,585
They're having a two-for-one
at Venezia's.

36
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51, 338
At this point,
I could eat a whole one by myself.

37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,050
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I can pick up a pizza.

38

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,302
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

39
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,765
He better not. Trust me, he does not want
to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.

40
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:07,062
-What's that sound?
-I just sold your favorite piece.

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,898
The hideous crying clown.

42
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,527
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

43
00203313, 7385 ==> 00303: 15,737
Shows what I know about art.

44
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,490
Hey, what do you think about Holly?

 

45
00703219,408 ==> 00703: 21,076
For the baby's name.

 

46
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,828
Do you like it?

47
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24, 663
I think I really like it.

48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,291
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,710
Let me think about it.

50
00#03.29,.918 => 00:03: 33,71
Just feels right, you know?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

It's my new favorite.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,674
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.

52
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:47,185
Listen, I was thinking, maybe we can
have a little family time this weekend.

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,396
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

54
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,606
You know, just take a drive.

55
00203251, 815 => 00:03:54,109
The almost four of us.

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,528
Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail...

57
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,865
...stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.

58
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,409
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

59
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,660
-I know.
-Yeah.

60
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,580
So why don't we just do that?
Take a little break?

61
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,541
Sold. Sounds fun.

62

Holly. It's growing on me.

63
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,130
Yep. Me too.

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,925
All right, well, I had better go
and get this in the mail.

65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,803
Why don't you call me
when you're on your way home?

66
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,265
-Will do. Love you.
-Love you too.

67
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,077
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

68
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,335
What the hell did we just walk into?

69
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19, 963
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,007
He was right here before.

71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,467
-Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
-No.

72
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,138
What do you figure? He maybe
headed down that gully there?

73
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,140
That's the way I'd go.

Frankie, Lester, go find him.

75

00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,103

Jack.

76

00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,605

These guys are DEA.

77

00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,157

No! Jack, no!

78

00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,034

Jack! Jack! Jack!

719

00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,994

No! No, don't!

80

00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,371

Jack, don't. No.

81

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,208

No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack,

82

no!

00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,545
-Jack, no. Don't kill him.

-Back it up.

83

00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,756

-Don't kill him, Jack.

-Get back here.

84

00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,257

The hell not? He's DEA.

85

00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,927

No, he's family.

86

00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,262

Say again?

87
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,057
He's my family.

88
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,225
He's my brother-in-law.

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,603
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us...

90

00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,272
...you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

 

91
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,693
-Did you know about this?
-I called you off, remember?

92
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,364
-I told you not to come.
-Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.

93
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,241
-You weren't supposed to be here.
-Too late now.

94
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,287
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here?

95
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,041
You and your brother-in-law
don't seem to be getting along too well.

96
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,169
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't concern you.

97
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,547
We just wasted his partner here,
and he's wearing a bullet...

98
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,384

-so, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.

99
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,303
This is between him and me.

100
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,640
-No cavalry coming?
-No.

101
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,268
-You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.
-No, no, no! Jack--

102
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,648
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

103
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,150
Not yet.

104
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,239
Hank.

105
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:14,202
Nothing can change
what just happened...

106
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,038
...but you can walk out of here alive...

107
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,918
...-if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.

108
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,923
Yeah, I thought as much.

109
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,801
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

110
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,970

No, no, no, listen! I have money!

111
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,224
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's....

112
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,855
It's $80 million.

113
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49, 362
Eighty million.

114
002083 53,992 ==> 00208257, 287
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

115
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,041
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

6
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,919
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything. Think about it.

7
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08, 423
You can have any future that you want.

8
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,134
Jack.

 

9
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,472
Eighty million.

20
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18, 433
And all you've got to do...

21
002093 19,392 ==> 00209221, 269
...is let him go.

 

 

22
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,313
That's a hell of an offer.

Would you take that deal?

It's Hank.

His name is Hank.

How about it, Hank?

28
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,746
Should I let you go?

And you can go fuck yourself.

31
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,805
Hank, listen to me.

32
00209:57,555 => 00:09:58,848
You gotta tell him.

 

33
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,601
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

134
00%10701,810 ==> 00:10: 03,978
Please. Please.

135
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,941
What? You want me to beg?

You're the smartest guy I ever met.

10 minutes ago.

Do what you're gonna do.

140

Pretty specific directions.

they say, "West on the 40...

...this or that exit, second gas station

on the left." You know?

This here? This is a whole other story.

44

where does it say this is exactly?

45
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,276
Yeah.

Right? Working with them. Should we
maybe find out what he told them first?

Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff...

...-that might not be too good for us.

95

00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,673
And I'll bet we could

get it out of him back home.

Oh, you know. This and that.

I got a call from Hank.

235
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,884
He arrested Walt three hours ago.

236
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30, 636
It's over.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

237
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,639
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

238
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,475
Hank and Steve Gomez are working
with a former associate of Walt's...

239
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,854
...Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know...

240
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,525
...and Pinkman has supplied them
with everything they need.

241
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,613
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.

242
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,408
And I, for one, could not be happier.

243
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,290
I almost didn't come here.

244
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03, 961
Christ, I barely even know
who you are...

245
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,631
..-and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.

246
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:17,558
And then I think about
how you were so upset with Walt...

247
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,561
...and how you wanted
the kids out of the house...

248
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,482

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
...and all of this makes me believe

that there has got to be hope for you...

249
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,486
...that whatever he did to you
can be undone.

250
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:38,037
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember...

25.1,
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,788
...is that you are my sister.

252
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,417
And so I'm here.

253:
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,965
-Marie--
-Everything changes now.

254
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,218
And you have got to prepare yourself.

255
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,554
Hank will help you as much as he can.
I know he will.

256
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:01,602
And I will support you through this.

257
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03, 937
But I have conditions.

258
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,441
Give me every single copy
of that obscenity...

Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here.

You are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything.

267
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,551
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

268

-Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
-No. No. No, he cannot know.

You tell him, or I will.

270

There's no way around this.

Hey, just go.

I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

289
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,668
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.

290
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,589
So you're saying all this time
you were lying about this?

I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.

292

You just admitted it.

293

So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

294

You can't talk to him for a while.

-I've tried. He's not answering.

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,552
Next order of business
is to get you a brand-new car seat.

425
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,054
Won't that be nice, Holly?

426
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,852
Mama.

427
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,020
Mama.

428
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,606
Mama.

429
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,901
Mama.

 

430

438
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,194
Abductor is the father....

439
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,700
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.

Bald head, goatee,
gold, wire-framed glasses.

441

Are you expecting a call?

442
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,797
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

443
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,216
Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.

-That's him. That's my husband.
-I need you to pick up the phone.

445
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,430
Start a trace on the landline.

446
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,102
-The number's 505-177-8987.
-I know you're there, so pick it up.

447
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,355
Skyler, you hear me?

448
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43, 650

-Need the location of an incoming caller.

-Answer the pho--

449
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49, 864
Walt, where's Holly?

450
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51, 658
Are you alone?

451
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53, 618
No police?

452
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,039
No. No police.

453
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01, 668
Where are you? Where's Holly?

454
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,006
-Walt!
-What the hell is wrong with you?

455
009412 07,215 =-> 00841311,1,77
Why can't you do one thing I say?

456
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,888
-What?
-This is your fault.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
457
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,849
This is what comes of your disrespect.

458
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,768
I told you, Skyler.

459
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,561
I warned you for a solid year.

460
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,314
You cross me,
there will be consequences.

 

 

461
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,566
What part of that
idn't you understand?

Q

462
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,486
You took my child.

463
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,071
Because you need to learn.

464
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,156
You bring her back.

465
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:36,577
Maybe now you'll listen.

Maybe now you'll use your damn head.

 

 

466
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,122
You know, you never believed in me.

467
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,417
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

468
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46, 337
"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.

469

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:50,383
You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.

470
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,802
Someone might get hurt."

471
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,723
You're always whining and complaining
about how I make my money...

472
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,852
..-just dragging me down,
while I do everything.

 

473
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,522
And now--

474
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,860
Now you tell my son what I do...

475
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:15,783
-after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.

476
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,912
You stupid bitch.

477
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,791
How dare you?

478
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,555
I'm sorry.

479
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,522
You have no right...

480
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,026
...to discuss anything about what I do.

481
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,487
What the hell do you know

about it anyway?

482
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,947
Nothing. I built this.

483
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,241
Me. Me alone. Nobody else!

484
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,035
You're right.

485
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,663
You're right.

486
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,334
You mark my words, Skyler.

487
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,338
Toe the line...

488
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,300

..or you will wind up just like Hank.

489
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,429
Walt.

490
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,600
Tell me what happened.

491
00243423,559 ==> 00243: 25,645
Where is Hank?

492
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,939
Please.

493
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,358
We need to know.

494
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,491
You're never gonna see Hank again.
495
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,873
He crossed me.

496
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,252
You think about that.

497
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,506
Family or no.

498
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,302
You let that sink in.

499
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,306
Walt.

500
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,561
I just want Holly back.

501
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,149
Please, Walt.

502
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,112
Just come home.

503
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,414
I've still got things left to do.

504
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,835
Hey.

You can come on out.

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,423
It's an actual store.

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,137
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner repair"
was a term of art.

If you would step right here

00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,760
Oh, Nebraska. What's in Nebraska?

You. From now on.

1
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40, 684
It's gonna take me some time

to get your new situation fixed.

 

 

12
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,147
Until then, you're gonna be staying here.
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.

Call it in, get her out of here. Move.

32
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,807
I get to his door...

33
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,351
..and I could hear music inside.

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,895
Like squeaky voices.

35
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,649
And I thought, you know, maybe....

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,570
I knocked on his door.

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,073
The music stopped,
and then he was right there.

38
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,994

That kid that went missing
up in White Horse.

You've got "concerns."

Don't worry. We'll take the time

Jack Welker and his men.

I'm sorry?

243
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,462
Ninety-two percent.

244
00820¢15,172 =-> 00220717, 883
=TFa ly?
-Tested it twice.

245
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,512
And it's blue, just like before.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

246
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,600
Ninety-two. That's Heisenberg level.

247
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,062
He's not with you?

248
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,107
Well, next best thing. Pinkman.

249
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,235
They're looking for Pinkman.

250
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,781
Well, they're not going to find him. He's
with us and he's not going anywhere.

25.1
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,708
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys
in Europe have been begging for, right?

252
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:01,093
I just think we work together good.

253
00221:02,386 ==> 00721: 04,555
We make a good team.

254
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,435
I think: ab"s -kind. Of...

255
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,896
..-mutually good.

256
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,067
Ninety-two percent.

257
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:55,231
Mr. Lambert,

welcome to New Hampshire.

 

 

258
00#22:13,249 => 00:22214,:875
All right.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
259
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,545
Let's have a look at this place.

260
00#22218,170 <> 003222 21,298
You got about a month's worth
of food on hand.

261
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:25,427
Most of it's canned goods,
but there's steaks in the freezer.

262
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,223
You got a generator outside,
works on LP.

263
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,017
Ought to be enough in the tank
to last the winter.

264
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:37,690
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do
for the lights, the TV, and the freezer.

265
00222:37,898 ==> 00:22: 39,108
That's a wood-burner.

266
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,569
Ought to warm the place up
pretty good.

267
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,071
Plus you can cook on it.

268
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,992
On the TV front,
the reception's pretty much nil.

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,744
You got some mountains in the way.

270
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,789

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal...

271
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,542
...but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.

272
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,254
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

273
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,048
Two copies.

274
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,051
I'm not much of a movie guy.

215
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,598
I'll make a supply run next month.

276
002233 10,931, == 00223; 14,143
You want something else to watch,
put it on the list.

277
00#23214,351. ——> 00:23:16,520
Supply run.

278
00223316, 729 --S 00¢23% 19,523
Fifty thousand dollars
for a trip to Costco.

279
00223219,732 =-> 00323: 21,066
It"s visk.

280
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,112
And risk is what you're paying me for,
not toilet paper.

281
00823425, 321 --—> 00223: 28,991
Risk and a 4400-mile round trip.

282
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,493
Mr. Lambert...

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
283
005234 32,761 --> 007232 35,706
.-my clients and I don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

284
00223:35,915 =-> 00:23:39,209
Normally you and I would have already
gone our separate ways...

285
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,921
...but you're you.

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,718
-Where's the phone?
-No phone.

287
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:54,516
Up here, ice storms equal service calls,
equal you in cuffs.

288
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,061
-Internet?
-Same deal.

289
002232 57,269 => 00324201, 732
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

290
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,277
You want news,
I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.

291
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:09,198
-Whatever you need, just put it on the list.
-Put it on the list. Yeah.

292.
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,951
Look, I have business to conduct.

293
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,373
Your business is your business.

294
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,417

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

My business is keeping you
out of custody.

295
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,545
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

296
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,756
Your face is all over TV.

297
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:30,552
You are the hottest client
I have ever had, by far.

298
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,766
It stands to reason
you've got to keep out of sight.

299
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,145
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

300
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,855
Nothing.

301
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,943
There's a little one-horse town
eight miles down the hill.

302
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,362
There's not a thing
on God's green earth...

303
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,990
.that I can do to stop you
going down there.

304
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,700
All I'm saying is...

305
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,371
..if you leave this place,
you will get caught.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
306
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,624
And I gotta tell you...

307
00225:00,833 => 00:25:04,502
aes if I find ovit. that
you've left the reservation...

308
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06, 922
...I won't be coming back.

309
00225:07,131 ==> 00:25:10,843
That is for my own safety.
You understand?

310
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14, 847
Sure.

311
002253 16,306 ==> 00225: 174725
Know how to work the stove?

312
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,728
-The flue can be tricky.
-Yeah, I got it.

313
00:25:25,691, -->. 00325527, 651
You paid good money for this.

314
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,405
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

315
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:37,535
Seems to me just the spot
for a man to rest up and think on things.

316
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,083
If you look around, it's kind of beautiful.

317
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,754
You've been very helpful. Thank you.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

318
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,714
See you in a month.

319
00227:25,853 ==> 00:27:27,437
Tomorrow.

320
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,693
Tomorrow.

321
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,826
Come--

322
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,624
Oh, so you're just too good
to eat with the rest of us, huh?

32:3:
00#282.28,832 ——> 00:28: 31,585
-It's not for me.
-Damn, man, seriously.

324
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,338
That's not my chocolate chip, is it?

325
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36, 632
You're gonna spoil him.

326
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,138
Hey, you awake?

327
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,058
Yeah.

328
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,061
We had some Ben &amp; Jerry's.

329
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:54,650
There's peanut butter cup
and AmeriCone Dream.

330
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,778
I didn't know what you liked,

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

so I got you some of each.

331
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,242
There you go.

332
00%29714,836 ==> 00:29:19,299
So that batch that you just cooked
was 96 percent.

333
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,928
Kind of figured you deserved
a little something.

334
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,181
Thanks.

335
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,408
Well, better get some sleep.

336
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,576
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

337
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,162
Got a whole new batch.

338
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,916
-Hey, Todd.
-Yeah?

339
00%29753,125 ==> 00329357045
Would you mind
leaving the tarp off tonight?

340
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,298
Well, might get cold.

341
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,842
No, I don't mind. I just....

342
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,344
I just wanna see the stars.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
343
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,517
Sure. Okay.

344
00230:10,726 =-> 00:30:12,227
Thanks.

345
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,815
Well, good night, Jesse.

346
00:30:17,941 =-> 00:30:19,443
Night.

 

347
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,003
Okay. Okay. Okay.

 

348
00:31:20,337 =-> 00:31:21,838
Okay.

349
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,664
Come on, bitch.

350
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,341
Go ahead! Do it!

351
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,096
Just kill me now and get it over with,
because there's no way...

352
00332:53,305 =-> 00:32:56,391
..-I'm doing one more cook
for you psycho fucks!

353
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,830
-Yes?
-Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?

354
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,540
You're Andrea, right?

355
00833221,416 => 00:332 22,792
How can I help you?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
356
00:33:23,001, --> 00:33% 25,837
You know Jesse Pinkman?

357
00#333.26,046 =—> 00:33:29,216
Right? Well, I'ma friend of his.
My name's Todd.

358
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:35,138
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but it's nice to meet you.

359
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,520
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

360
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,063
Yeah, he's okay.

361
005334 43,271 ==> 007333 45,357
Actually, I brought him with me.

362
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,816
Jesse's here?

363
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,279
Yeah, he's right over there
in that truck.

364
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,334
Where?

365
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,879
No!

366
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,303
Just so you know, this isn't personal.

367
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,389
No!

368
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,454

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Whoa, hey, settle down.

369
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,957
Settle down.

370
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,751
Hey, remember.

371
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,962
There's still the kid.

372
00235751,858 ==> 002358 55,,8'62
I brought you a couple of cases of
Ensure. Maybe put a little weight on you.

373
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,238
Jesus.

374
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,783
I can barely read this.

315)
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,201
Almost forgot.

376
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,121
Without a prescription, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun it.

377
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,832
One of these ought to come close.

378
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,088
Did you check on them?

379
00#36:13,296 => 00:36: 14,923
Is Skyler in a better place?

380

00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,343
No, she's still at that place
off of Eubank.

 

 

381

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,887
Kids are both still with her
for the moment.

382
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,515
There's no court date yet.

383
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:28,228
The news was talking about a grand jury,
but they didn't say when.

384
00#36:28,436 <-> 00:36: 31,815
I saw her public defender on TV.

385
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,275
Looks like a deer in the headlights.

386
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,112
Think I got socks older than him.

387
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,408
What are they doing for money?

388
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43, 660
She's doing taxi dispatch, part-time.

389
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,372
Leaves the baby with a neighbor
when she goes in.

390
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,583
I saw her shopping one time.

391
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,168
She looks pretty good.

392
00236352,377 ==> 0073.6: 54,796
And she's using her maiden name.

393
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,550
I wouldn't take that personally,
under the circumstances.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

394
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,844
Those working for you?

395
00#37:01,052 => 00:37:02, 762
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,682
I took a run by your old house.

397
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,185
The auction's still pending.
They put a fence up around it.

398
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,478
They put up a fence?

399
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,774
Seems like the place got to be kind of
a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.

400
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,112
The neighbors complained,
so the bank put up a fence.

401
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,493
You ready?

402
00237:30,540 => 00:37: 31,916
Yeah.

403
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,131
Sorry about last time.

404
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:44,095
It should go better now.
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.

405
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,223
It's all about finding the vein.

406

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,144
Give it to me. I'll do it.

407
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,369
Here, you do it.

408
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,875

That's it. Okay. Hey.

 

412

Pretty good. There you go.

What happens to it then?

432
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08, 948
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?
433
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,248
Would you do it?

434
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,339
If I said yes...

435
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,092
...would you believe me?

436
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,271
You wanna cut the cards?

437

No.

A king.

--and Melanson
with a good look makes the save.

528
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,605
That's why you need good, solid
breakout passes.

Matt Peterson-- Win the draw, Englehart
wins the draw, back to Peterson...

breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.

.the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz
Foundation...

545

-announced a $28 million grant...

546
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:55,075
.for drug-abuse treatment centers
throughout the Southwest.

547
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,244
Charlie, the Southwest is our home...

548
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:01,248
...and we couldn't just ignore
what's going on in our own backyard.

549
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:05,336
But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motives.

550
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,422
Andrew Ross Sorkin
of The New York Times...

551
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,758
..wrote a column suggesting...

552
00250:10,966 =--> 00:50:15,262
...that the grant was
a kind of publicity maneuver...

553.
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,891
...to shore up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies...

554
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,812
...because of your association
with Walter White.

555)

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,900
-Well, that's not exactly the way--
-To cleanse yourselves, so to speak...

556
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:33,364
...of having a methamphetamine kingpin
as cofounder of your company.

557
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,741
Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.

558
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,078
I have to believe that
the investing public understands...

559
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,498
..we're talking about a person
who was there early on...

560
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,668
...but who had nothing to do
with the creation of the company...

561
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,295
...and still less to do with growing it.

562
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:52,007
So, what was Walter White's

contribution?
563
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,761
You know, to be honest.... Honey?
564

00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,097
-The company name.
-The company name.

565
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,975
We came up with it
by combining our names.

566
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,518
"Schwartz" means "black."

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
567
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,980
-Black plus white makes gray.
-Hence Gray Matter Technologies.

568
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,942
Exactly. As far as I can recall,
his contribution begins and ends there.

569
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,987
There are continuing reports
of blue methamphetamine...

570
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,782
...considered his signature product
throughout the Southwest...

571
008512 16,991. <> 002512 20,286
...and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.

572
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,999
So my question is,
is Walter White still out there?

573
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,167
No, he's not.

574
00%51:227,.376 =--> 00:51:30,754
You sound very sure.

I am.

576
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:37,720
I can't speak to this Heisenberg
that people refer to...

 

 

577
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,223
...but whatever he became...

578
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,310

...the sweet, kind, brilliant man...

579
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,731
...that we once knew long ago,
he's gone.

580
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,442
But to be absolutely clear....

581
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,804
Police! Hands! Show us your hands.
Show us your hands.

582
00252221,013 --> 00:52:22,514
What's going on?

583
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,893
Let's see your hands!

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,920
Just get me home.

2
00:02:11,048 =-> 00:02:13,175
Just get me home.

3
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,802
I'll do the rest.

4
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,780
Yes, hello, this is David Linn
from The New York Times.

5
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,534
May I speak with Susan, please?
Thank you.

6
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,373
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

7
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34, 668
I was just calling to see if we can set--

8
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,047
Well, yes. Well, I figured
we'd have to do the interview by phone...

9
00205:39,256 <-> 00705241, 299
...Since they've already left New York.

10
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,220
But what we'd really love to get
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz...

1
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,305
...to go along with the article.

12
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,226
When are they scheduled
to get home?

13

00905452, 727 =-> 00205: 57,356
Oh, so they'll be home tonight. Gotcha.

14
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:02,571
Now, the address I have on them
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

5
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,907
No, it isn't. They've-- Let me get a pen.

6
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,952
Where do they...?

7
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,038
Tesuque. I see.

8
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,082
And the address?

 

9
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,672
Is that up near the opera house?
I hear that's nice.

20
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,009
Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer...

21
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,177
...to check on his schedule.

22
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,179
No, no, it's their call.

23
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:32,017
I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

24
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,560
Thank you.

25
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,063
This should make one hell of a story.

26
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,398
Goodbye.

27
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,293
I'm just saying,
it's apples and oranges.

28
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,506
Listen, I maintain, if I want pizza...

29
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,467
-...I go to a pizza place.
-Yeah.

30
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,637
If I want Thai, I go to a Thai place.

Si.
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,849
-What is the point in comparing...
-Did I marry you?

32
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,268
-...pizza to Thai?
-What has happened?

33
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,604
-This is different.
-They're completely--

34
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,065
Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

35
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,277
I am the guy who wants to end
this ridiculous conversation...

36
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,906
...kick off my shoes,
and have a very large glass of wine.

37

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,787
Well, I'm gonna tell you
to be my guest.

38
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,038
All right, wait.

39
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,209
The answer is 21.

40
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,877
-No.
=Yes’.

41
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,421
Yes, because it has history.

42
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,090
Come on.

43
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46, 633
Prohibition.

44
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,220
-The Sweet Smell of Success.
-And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

45
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,807
-Game, set, and match.
-The whole vibe is so Yountville.

46
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,976
You transplant it to Manhattan--

47
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,728
Transplant it to Islamabad,
I would eat there.

48
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,355
Oh, there's a good thought.

49
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,441

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

-What, Islamabad?
-No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

50
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,279
Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
Do you think Juana left us anything?

51
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,616
She doesn't think we're coming back
until Wednesday.

52
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,494
-Unless you told her.
-No, I haven't talked to her.

53
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,746
Oh, look, here.

54
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,457
-Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
~Yeah.

55
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,669
You wanna get us
a nice bottle of wine?

56
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25, 380
Do you think we have any of those--?

57
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28, 967
What are those crackers with,
like, the sun-dried tomato...

58
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,429
..and they were slightly peppery,
but not too peppery.

59
002083 32,637 ==> 00208235,181
-We don't have them?
-No.

60
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,476
-Ask Juana.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
-We haven't had them in forever.

61
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,230
-I don't know why she doesn't get those.
-Why don't you talk to her?

62
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,566
She's got that thing with her daughter.

63
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,818
-Anyway, Napa?
-Yeah.

64
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,237
-How long since we've been?
-Two years.

65
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,239
Jesus, that's two years.

66
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53, 658
-Yeah, too long, right?
-Is this okay?

67
00208353,867 ==<> 00208255,577
Oh, that looks perfecto.

68
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,747
You wanna get the fireplace?

69
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,166
Is it good?

70
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02, 959
Is it ripe?

71
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,295
Yeah.

72
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,965
We could invite George and Delores.
They could come up from Marin.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

73
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,134
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

74
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,096
We could have a little spa action, right?

75
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,224
And then we could do
some sort of wine, and then--

76
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,069
Hello, Gretchen.

77
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,279
Elliott.

78
00:09:33,031 =-> 00:09:35,617
I really like your new house.

79
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
Walt.

THAIS y 94 x

81
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,841
Are we looking east?

82
002093 54,1385 ==> 00209% 58,973
My God, you must have one great view
of the Sangre de Cristos.

83
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,685
Walt, what are you doing here?

84
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,856
I saw you on Charlie Rose.

85
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,400
You looked great.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
86
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,989
-You both did.
-If you are here to--

87
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:20, 328
-To hurt us--
-Walt, whatever it is you're planning--

88
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,248
Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

89
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,627
It's out in my car.

90
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,340
How about the three of us take a walk
to it? It's just parked down the road.

91
00:10:32,549 -->. 00:10:35,135
I couldn't get it past your gate.

92
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46, 688
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way...

93
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49, 399
-you'll need a bigger knife.

94
00:10:59,033 --> 00: 101,244
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

95
00: 208,293 --> 00: 210,587
That's all right.

96
00: 210,795 --> 00: 714,048
Yeah, just throw it on top.

 

97
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,513
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't
want to lose any under the furniture.

 

 

 

 

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

0.1,
00#11:35,195 =-> 00:11: 38,114
I earned it,
and you're going to give it to my children.

 

 

 

102
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,241
-What? Why?
-Walt, I don't think we--
103
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,285
On my son's 18th birthday...
104
00: 242,493 --> 00: 746,247
...-which is 10 months
and two days from today...
105
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,416
-you will give him this money...
106
00: 248,625 --> 00: 750,668
..-in the form of an irrevocable trust.
107
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,714

You will tell him that it is his
to do with as he sees fit...

108
255,924 --> 00:12:00,762
...but with the hope
that he uses it for his college education.

 

00:1

109
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,184
-And for the betterment of his family.
-Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

110
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,061
Why...?

Atal,
00#12:08,269 => 00:12: 10,563
I mean, why, in particular, would we--?

112
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,900
If you wanna give your kids drug money,
go do it yourself.

3
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,401
I can't.

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,820
y wife and son hate me.

gS

5
00%12<18,029 ==> 00312: 20,531
They won't take my money.

6
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,200
Even if they did...

 

 

7
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,411
..the federal government
wouldn't let them.

118
00212:.26,955 =-> 00:12: 31,542
But two rich benefactors who are known
for their charitable endeavors...

 

 

119
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,838
.--who would think nothing of,

for instance, writing a $28 million check...

120
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,634
...to help victims
of methamphetamine abuse?

121
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,054
I have to think that your money
would be very welcome.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
122

00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,473
It wouldn't make any sense

coming from us.

123

00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,350

It certainly would.

124

00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:52,063
My children are blameless victims
of their monstrous father.

25

00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,816
A man who you once knew quite well.

26

00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,449

Call it a beau geste,

call it liberal guilt...

27

00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,868
...call it whatever you want, but do it.

00:

28
13:06,828 --> 00:13:13,376

And you are not to spend
a single dime of your own money.

31
3:22,593 --> 00:13:24,220
Okay, Walt, sure.

32
B49 249429 == 0013: 27y 307
That sounds reasonable.

 

33
3:28,933 --> 00:13:30,643
So, what happens next?
34
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:36,190
I guess we shake on it, and I leave.
35
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,139
I can trust you to do this.
36
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,640
Yes.
37
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,851
Absolutely you can.
38
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,579
Don't move. Don't--

Don't dare move a muscle.

139

00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:36,209
You don't want them to think that

you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

140

00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,464
Just this afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000...

00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,132
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year...

151,
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,095
.-when you're going for a walk in Santa Fe
or Manhattan or Prague, wherever...

152
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:34,892
...and you're talking
about your stock prices...

153
00215436, 727 ==> 00215: 39,981
.. without a worry in the world.

154
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,234
And then suddenly...

155
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,571
...you'll hear the scrape
of a footstep behind you...

156
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,823
...but before you can even turn around:

Cheer up, beautiful people.

159
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,637
This is where you get to make it right.

160
00216:59,769 ==> 00:17:01,395
Oh, yeah, right.

161
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,865
You know, I don't exactly know

how to feel about all this.

62
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,116
For real, yo.

63
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,412
Whole thing felt kind of shady,
you know, like, morality-wise?

 

64
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,623
Totally.
65

00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,293
How do you feel now?

 

66
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,006
-Better..

-Yeah, definitely improving.

167
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,719
What's this I hear about
blue meth still being out there?

168
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,848
-What do you mean?
-Have you heard anything?

169
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,351
Is it still being sold?

170
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,146
Yeah.

-You said he moved to Alaska.
-That's what I heard.
180
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,305
Right on, Jesse.
181
00218:17,513 --> 00:18:19,015

 

Passing the torch.

Whoa, what happened there?

It's my birthday.

185
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,627
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

186
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:05,055
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say
the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

187
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,892
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

188
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
Get a little excitement in your life.

189
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,938
Yeah, someday.

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,093

-No, thank you.

00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,847
-Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
-All right, you got it.

92
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,698
Hey, how you doing?

93
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,450
Good.

94
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,953

That's a nice color on you.

It's kind of a--

00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,971
I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
It's kind of a cornflower blue.

201

-Nobody knows that I'm here.

203
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,355
Just listen for two minutes,
and then I'll leave.

204
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,109
Please. No. Please.

205
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,737
Just two minutes of your time.
That's all I ask.

206

...just trying to stay one step ahead
of the police.

22.1.
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,564
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

222
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,776
How much would it cost us?

223
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,279
Nothing short of a million.

224
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,784
And believe me, for this,
that is giving it away.

225
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,955
-I think Jack should hear this.
-Yeah, I don't know.

226
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:22,252
Now, listen, I can come up there tonight
and talk to him.

227
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,171
He'd get it.

228
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,383
This is a win-win situation.

229
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,803
-Hi, what can I get for you two?
-He's just leaving.

230
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,722
Good seeing you again. Take care.

231
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,811
For you?

232

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,062
I'm good.

233
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,480
And I need more stevia.

234
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,411
Okay, no disrespect to the man,
but doing business with him?

235)
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,829
Right now, that's not--

236
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,623
Of course we're not doing business
with him.

237
008252 01,125 <-> 0025: 02, 710
Todd, please.

238

Don't make me walk you through this.

Jesus. Did you look at him?

240
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,140
You'd be doing him a favor.

241
00:27:01,619 =-> 00:27:05,916
Hello, please record after the tone.

Truce, all right?

243
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,463
Skyler, I have news about Walt,
and you need to hear it...

244
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,799
...So if you're there, pick up.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

245
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,510
Skyler--

246
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,304
Hey.

247
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,723
What's up?

248
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,684
Walt's in town.

249
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,352
Yeah?

250
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,147
That car they thought he stole
in New Hampshire...

251
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,441
...they found it in a Denny's parking lot
right on Central.

252
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:35,154
And your next-door neighbor,
on the right-- What's her name, Becky?

253
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,907
-Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.
-Becky, Carol, whatever.

254
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,493
She saw him at your old house.

255
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,829
Just this morning, plain as day.

256
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,542
He's there, walking out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

257

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,130
-He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--?
-No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

258
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,049
Or Carol, whatever.

259
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,635
She said he looked exactly
like the Unabomber.

260
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,598
But she's positive it was him.
They're getting calls from all over town.

261
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05, 683
He's here, he's there,
he's going to blow up city hall.

262
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,896
He has some sort of manifesto.
He wants to be on the news.

263
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,482
-Who's making these calls? Him?
-There are two or three voices.

264
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16, 361
They're not sure if they're crank calls
or people he's put up to it...

265
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,614
...or if they're actual anonymous tips.

266

00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,575
It's stretching them thin,
which is maybe the point.

 

267
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,160
As far as I'm concerned...

268
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,247
...there are three places that he would go:

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
To you, to me, or Flynn.

269
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,916
Right.

270
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,876
They're watching the high school.

271
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,296
They're probably watching
your place too.

272
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,048
I mean...
273

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,259
...I know that's what Hank would do.

274
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:44,139
There is no way Walt's getting to you.
They are absolutely going to catch him.

215)
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,432
No doubt about it.

276
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,478
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

277
00228:50,145 ==> 00:28:52,022
But on the off chance....

278
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,107
Yeah.

279
00228:54,316 ==> 00:28:58,111
On the million-to-one chance...

280
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,989
-you be on the lookout, okay?

A burial site.

That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

It's where I buried our money.

Yes.

Christ, that is one fine head of hair.

375
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,965
I mean, otherwise,
you look like shit, but--

376
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,595
Hello to you too, Jack.
Now, can we talk business?

377
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,889
I don't think so, no.

378
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,060
-Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?
-Yeah, he told me.

00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,189
The thing is
we're not really in the market.

You're low on methylamine.
What happens then?

381
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,570
No, we'll get more.

382

That Quayle woman's got her own setup.

She can break loose a barrel.
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

384
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,456
Todd, please, would you explain things
to your uncle?

385
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,167
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

386
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,880
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

387
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,842
I'm sorry.

388
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,764
-Wait. Jack.
-Where do you want it?

389
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,266
I don't know,
anywhere but my living room?

390

-Take him out back.
-Jack, look, you owe me.

391

-You owe me.
-Hey, hey, hey.

-Let's go.
-I owe you, what for?

you would kill him, and you didn't.

-All right.

395
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,781
-You're his partner now--
-Whoa, stop.

396
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,749
Partners? What are you talking about?

397
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,376
He's alive, isn't he?

398
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,545
He's cooking for you.

399
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,422
What, are you gonna lie?

400
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,342
Him being alive
is not him and me being partners.

401
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,261
Not by a damn sight.

402
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,180
What, you think I'd partner with a rat?

403
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59, 434
-Where is that little piece of shit?
-He's finishing up a batch.

 

 

404
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,269
Go get him. Bring him here.

405
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04, 689

He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.

Let's get this over with.

just how wrong you are.

Then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

411

Yeah, you see what I'm talking about,
you son of a bitch?

412
00243225,812 => 00:43:27,730
Now, does this look
like a partner to you?

413

Come here. Take a look.

414
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,068
Come here!

415
00:43:43,704 -->
Take a look

00:43:45,331
at him.

416
00:43:45,540 -->
Have a

00:43:47,625

Hardworking, good partner.
Fifty-fifty partner.

Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?

421

-Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

You want your money, right?

427
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,009
You wanna know where it is?

428
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,679
You pull that trigger, you'll never--

429
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,189
Do it.

430
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,907
You want this.
